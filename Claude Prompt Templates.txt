## 🚨 EMERGENCY REMINDER PHRASES

Use these when Claude forgets your preferences:

**"Check project instructions"**
→ Makes Claude re-read your full project instructions

**"Show inline, don't create files"**
→ When Claude starts creating unnecessary files

**"I'm NOT using Base44 backend"**
→ When Claude confuses your architecture

**"Only validated external links"**
→ When discussing resource links

**"Focus on MY code, not Base44 reference"**
→ When conversation drifts to Base44 implementation details

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE PROMPTS

### Be Specific About Output:
❌ "Help me with service tags"
✅ "Show me inline how to add tooltip hover states to my ServiceTag component"

### State Your Constraints:
❌ "Add authentication"
✅ "Add authentication using Supabase Auth - show code inline, only create file if it's over 100 lines"

### Reference Past Work:
❌ "Do that thing we did before"
✅ "Use the same pattern we implemented for service tags, but apply it to insurance badges"

### Provide Context:
❌ "This isn't working"
✅ "The ResourceDetail page shows undefined for resource.services array - here's the error: [paste error]"

---

## 📝 EXAMPLE: COMPLETE PROMPT

```
I need to add a filter dropdown to my FindProviders page that lets users filter by insurance accepted.

**Current setup:**
- ResourceDetail already shows insurance badges using ServiceTag component
- Each resource has an `insurances` array with slugs like ['florida-medicaid', 'aetna']
- Insurance data is in /src/data/resources/insurances/*.json

**Requirements:**
1. Add insurance filter dropdown to FindProviders page
2. Use same Select component pattern as existing category filter
3. Filter should work alongside existing category/city/service filters
4. Show count of results that accept each insurance

**What I need:**
- Show me the code changes inline
- Point out exactly where in FindProviders.tsx to add this
- Only create a file if this requires a new component

---
Stack: React + Supabase (NOT Base44 backend)
Show code inline - only create files if I explicitly ask
Check project instructions if unsure about preferences
```

---

## 🎯 CUSTOMIZATION NOTES

**Modify the footer reminder based on conversation:**
