## 🚀 QUICK START (3 STEPS):

### STEP 1: DATABASE
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# 1. Paste supabase_schema_CORRECTED.sql
# 2. Click Run
# 3. Verify: Should see "26 new columns"
```

### STEP 2: ADD .HTACCESS FILE
```bash
# In your project:
# 1. Go to `public` folder (create if missing)
# 2. Create file named `.htaccess`
# 3. Copy content from htaccess_content.txt
# 4. Save
```

### STEP 3: UPDATE CODE
You need the corrected TypeScript code for `providersearch.tsx`. 

**Should I create that file now?** 

It will have:
- ✅ Corrected type definitions (simplified names)
- ✅ Fixed filter toggle (allows multiple selections)
- ✅ Section labels added
- ✅ service_type display removed
- ✅ All new columns in Supabase query
