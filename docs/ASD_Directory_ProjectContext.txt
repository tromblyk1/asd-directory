You are assisting with a full-stack project called **ASD Directory**.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
This is a Florida Autism Services Directory built with:
- Frontend: React + Vite + Supabase
- Backend: Python scripts for data scraping, cleaning, and enrichment
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/tromblyk1/asd-directory

ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:
- Root project path: C:\Projects\ASD-Directory
- Python virtual environment: venv
- Key files: .gitignore, requirements.txt, README.md, organize_asd_directory.ps1, setup_git_project.ps1
- Python dependencies are locked in requirements.txt
- Git repository initialized, first commit pushed to GitHub (branch: main)
- Using VS Code with Git integration and Codex/Continue AI for editing

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
C:\Projects\ASD-Directory\
├─ src\                 → React frontend
├─ scripts\             → Python crawlers, normalizers, and data tools
├─ data\                → CSVs, Supabase exports, and scraped datasets
├─ assets\              → Provider images, icons, and logos
├─ supabase\            → SQL schema or migrations (optional)
├─ venv\                → Python virtual environment
├─ .gitignore
├─ requirements.txt
├─ README.md
└─ PowerShell helpers:
     - organize_asd_directory.ps1
     - setup_git_project.ps1

CURRENT STATUS:
- GitHub repo created and connected successfully.
- Python environment working (pandas, selenium, supabase, etc. installed).
- Project structure standardized and organized under one root.
- `.gitignore` excludes venv, data, and asset files.
- Initial commit pushed: “Initial commit – clean project setup”.

YOUR ROLE:
Act as my **technical co-pilot** for this project.  
When I continue this thread, you will:
- Write production-ready PowerShell, Python, or TypeScript/React code following this folder structure.  
- Keep paths relative (never absolute) unless stated otherwise.  
- Maintain clarity and conciseness in all answers.
- Assume my venv and frontend dev server are already running.  
- Always explain why a step is necessary if configuration or Git commands are involved.  
- When generating code, ensure it’s immediately runnable inside this project environment.

START BY:
Acknowledging this setup, confirming you understand the environment and repo structure,  
and then waiting for my next instruction.
