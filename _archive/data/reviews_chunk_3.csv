Paw Haven Animal Hospital,(863) 293-1428,ChIJg7rudiht3YgRnqd27uP5yVc,Carlos Defreitas,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I can’t say enough good things about Paw Haven Animal Hospital. From the moment we walked in, the staff treated us with kindness, professionalism, and genuine care. The front desk team was welcoming and efficient, and the technicians handled my schnauzer with such patience and compassion that it immediately put us both at ease.

My schnauzer was viciously attacked by a much larger dog, and the doctors at Paw Haven Animal Hospital quite literally **saved her life**. They acted quickly, provided expert treatment, and guided me every step of the way through a very stressful situation. We are forever grateful to them for giving my little one a second chance.

The doctors are extremely knowledgeable and take the time to explain everything in detail, making sure I fully understood my pet’s needs and treatment options. What really stood out was their balance of professionalism with a true love for animals—you can tell they treat each pet as if it were their own.

The hospital itself is very clean, well-organized, and well equipped, which gave me confidence that my pet was in the best hands. On top of that, their services are reasonably priced, especially considering the exceptional level of care they provide. They even followed up after the visit to check on my schnauzer, which meant a lot and showed how much they care beyond the appointment.

If you are looking for a veterinary clinic where you and your pet will be treated with respect, compassion, top-quality care, and fair pricing, Paw Haven Animal Hospital is the place to go. I highly recommend them!",2025-08-29 14:11:55,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU2PSs9L9SKXrXKce2uWorsTjp_SALfd9z0IUiOtartenkeXXLa=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:15:25.308638,,

I called almost every vet in town and no one could see my fur baby till like 3 days later and they were the only vet to get our baby in and they did an emergency surgery the very next morning and thanks to them our fur baby is still alive and for that and everything else they did and I will always be grateful to them for that and just being great, kind, and supportive people who care as much as we do for our fur babies.

Pawfect Pals Miami,(786) 505-3346,ChIJXyYiDjq32YgR6bjMIBXQ3ic,Terner Papir,5,"I’ve been a Pawfect Pals client since January of 2024. When I started a new job that required me to be in the office 5 days per week, I visited and interviewed every dog walking service I could find for my (reactive and admittedly difficult) 6.5lb long-haired chihuahua Tuco.  Nicole and her team go above and beyond all the rest, and you won’t find another pet care service that is as communicative and trustworthy as Pawfect Pals!!

After having walkers come get him for about a year, Tuco was exhibiting some aggressive behaviors if anyone besides his favorite walker was available. Rather than drop Tuco and me as clients, Nicole suggested that Tuco may do better going to daycare. I was extremely hesitant at first given Tuco’s reactivity towards other dogs on walks, but I can honestly say without a doubt it is the best thing I could have possibly done for my baby.

Over the last 6 months, Tuco’s true personality has come through and he is even making a few bark buddies, which is translating so well to his reactivity training. When Tuco realizes we’re pulling up to daycare, I no longer exist to him; he’s looking out the window, wagging his tail, and practically jumping out of the car as soon as Nicole or Karla open the door. Other than an all you can eat buffet, I’m pretty sure Tuco would say Pawfect Pals is the most magical place on earth 😂.

Nicole and her team treat my spicy chihuahua like the VIP (very important pup) that this overly neurotic millennial dog mom (that’s me) raised him to be. In short if you’re looking for someone to help you care for your pet, you couldn’t do any better than Pawfect Pals!",2025-08-12 16:44:10,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWioqt3ZnILcT4G5RAA2e2HGZ7aMo3rGzqHaM9cT0igGrvLk_5D=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:26.541275,,

From the very beginning, they went above and beyond to help us train together and make sure we were not only a good match, but also safe and successful as a team.

What really stands out is that their support doesn’t end when the training ends. They trained Mia with me over two years ago, and to this day I can reach out and they treat me as if I just entered the program. They never “write you off”, they truly mean it when they say, “we’re here if you need anything, now or in the future.”

Everyone I have ever met or spoken to through their organization has been kind, patient, and genuinely committed to helping. They care deeply about both the veteran and the dog, and they’re always ready with resources, encouragement, or hands-on guidance.

As a 20+ year veteran, 100% permanently and totally disabled with mobility challenges, I can honestly say Paws 4 Liberty has helped me tremendously, and continues to help as my needs evolve.

I highly recommend this organization to any veteran in need of a service dog. From one veteran to another: trust them, respect them, and give them the patience and kindness they so freely give. They are truly a wonderful organization.",2025-08-27 06:21:50,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKYzKP6pMsTWrhBGucgraN89i6YJpL0TDAbdUxaVn1lMjcu9Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:27.739706,,

Paws On The Ground Dog Training,(656) 219-4263,ChIJBV6F_iKRwogR8l90wJQyVsY,Katie McDow,5,"Absolutely the best decision we made for our dog!
We spoke with several trainers before finding Paws on the Ground, and none of them felt right—until we met Kristin and Corey in St. Petersburg. They immediately made us feel safe and supported. Our dog Beatrice is a rescue, and I was so nervous to send her to a board and train, worried she might feel abandoned again. But from the moment we dropped her off, they treated her like their own—sweet voices, gentle pets, and so much kindness.

They kept us updated with pictures and messages (which I loved!), and the difference in Bea after training is incredible. Before, she pulled hard on walks, jumped on us constantly, and tried to dart out the door. Now she walks beautifully on a loose leash, rarely jumps, and waits patiently at the door. She still has her happy, quirky personality—just in a much more manageable way!

The fact that they offer free lifetime refreshers and training tune-ups during boarding is such a bonus. I was hesitant about the cost, but now that I’ve seen the results, I’d do it all over again. If you’re thinking about training with Kristin and Corey—go for it. You won’t regret it!",2025-04-25 11:03:58,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVeuJee70-7fZDpA4JfV2oJRCdllXFlDvpJB4CGzkvcTgew4q7mmQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:15:28.322560,,
Paws On The Ground Dog Training,(656) 219-4263,ChIJBV6F_iKRwogR8l90wJQyVsY,Rachel Will,5,"Kristen and her husband are absolutely amazing! We started Baylor (German shepherd) in their 2-week puppy class, and we loved it so much that we sent her back for the 2-week adult training. The change in Baylor was incredible , she came back so much calmer, more confident, and well-behaved. I honestly get compliments on her all the time when we’re out and about!

What really sets Kristen apart is how much she truly cares about the dogs. You can tell she isn’t just going through the motions,  she genuinely loves working with them. I always felt completely comfortable leaving Baylor with her, knowing she was in the best hands. She also would send me cute videos of her progress!

If you want a trainer who’s skilled, kind, and truly cares about your dog, Kristen and her husband are the ones to trust. I can’t recommend them enough!
They’re truly the best!!!

We finished our 3 week board and train with Kellen. At first we were hesitant about leaving our puppy for 3 weeks but after Jett went through his 3 week hybrid training and getting to know Kellen we felt so much more comfortable leaving Jett. He is so much more manageable at home.  Kellen did an amazing job with Jett. He gave us the tools we needed to continue his training at home.

Paws On The Ground Dog Training,(656) 219-4263,ChIJBV6F_iKRwogR8l90wJQyVsY,Cin Jathar,1,"I trusted POTG (new port richey ) to train my dog , as she isn’t always good with other dogs. I was told 4-5 weeks wil be enough time for this training. I won’t get into the promises that I was told that were completely untrue, but I will say this….i repeated myself a minimum of 5 times at how worried I was about the heat and her overheating (she’s a big girl)…I repeated a minimum of 5 times  that I needed to see the facility of where she would be staying and training, as I was told her training would be mostly indoor due to it being August in Florida and she overheats….
Long story short, I was told that everything would be just fine…just pay and go and trust us.
Well, I don’t trust them and I will never again go to a dog train/board unless there are cameras and I suggest nobody else does either.
I can only thank God that something kept telling me to go get my dog. I ignored the nagging voice for 1 week and then it was too much to think about. I sent my brother and sister (unannounced) to get my girl. They were right near the new port richey facility.
I truly believe , had I not finally listen to my instinct, my dog wouldn’t be here today.
My dog (after 1 week) had lost at least 5 pounds….her breathing when she got into the car was terrifying. My sister took video once she got home to give water (too long to upload)
She was bleeding from a big sore on her leg and it was infected …she  was so thirsty she couldn’t stop drinking water. It was dangerous how dehydrated she was.
To top it off, she had a horrible urinary tract infection  (probably from not having water) .
Lastly, for at least a week after I got her, she wouldn’t stop chasing her tail. Makes me wonder if she was ever out of her “cage”.
I don’t know if I can forgive myself for only going by “reviews”. They have good reviews, but they’re shared with all the other locations , so I don’t think it’s a fair assessment.
I plead with Paws On The Ground , change your practices! I was told after the fact, that water is kept from the dogs as a training tactic!!!! You cannot do this . Especially in Florida!
Anyone considering training anywhere, unless they have cameras full time, don’t send your precious animals to them.

We went there to try and see what they could tell us about my conures broken leg.
and the doctor confirmed to us that it was a broken leg and They gave us a price estimate of $800. The doctor said that the way he knew was because he felt his bone with his hand and knew it was out of place. Then later he told us that he knew because he took an X-ray (He took the x-ray before we decided to go through with any procedure, and we did not ask him to take an x-ray). We decided to go through with the procedure and then the doctor told us that he did not want to do the procedure because the birds bones were already mending.

Paws and Tails Reiki & Therapeutic Massage,(727) 440-4325,ChIJxRsBR2XxwogRcIVz1ts41cs,Margy Roberts,5,"My 10+ year old dog Finnegan, a large Great Pyrenees mix, had lateral suture surgery on both of his hind legs on the same day to stabilize his knees.  The trauma was further multiplied when the callous on his elbow burst, and next when he became lethargic and we found out that the NSAIDs may have caused possible liver and kidney issues.  He also was emotionally out of sorts and would not venture out in his beloved back yard where he had once ruled the roost.

The cascading health events caused a delay in the mobility therapy I had planned for him.   I felt overwhelmed until I found Jill at Paws and Tails Reiki & Therapeutic Massage.  After clearing with the surgeon, I bought a package of Reiki and massage.  I can honestly say it has not only helped Finn with mobility, stress, and healing, but it has helped me too so that I can be armed with knowledge, healing homework, and tools to manage both of our stress levels brought about by the traumatic health issues.

Jill's kindness mixed with professional experience has helped both Finn and I cope with this trying experience.  Thank you so much Jill for all your help so far.  I really especially enjoy watching you work your magic during massage and loosening up that facia!  The pro tips are golden and much appreciated including “inch worms” head to tail, support knee and hock while working on PT's prescribed range of motion exercises while being careful never to dig into the groin, flexing foot exercises, healing hands when in proper frame of mind and doing the all-important light work, meditation, that is part of Reiki, etc.

Pawsitive Dog Training,(561) 703-3542,ChIJ3R7X3e0f2YgR9WwGLDguUAg,Olenka Coughlan,5,"Lori is a skilled and patient trainer who helped both of our Huskies thrive.

Lori trained our first Husky five years ago, so when we decided to add another furry family member we knew exactly who to call. Our second pup, Wembley, turned out to be a whole new level of challenge. Crate training, obedience, potty training, and leash walking were all uphill battles. We enrolled her in the Dream Dog program just like we did with our first, and Lori not only trained Wembley but also coached us through the chaos of raising a spirited Husky puppy. In those exhausting early weeks with sleepless nights and endless accidents, she was our go-to lifeline, reminding us it would get better. And she was right.

When Wembley first met Lori, she
screamed with excitement for a full ten minutes. Not to be left out, our other Husky joined in, and suddenly we were living one of those wild TikTok Husky videos with two dogs howling in perfect sync. Lori never missed a beat. She calmly helped us settle them down and dove right into the work. Under her guidance, Wembley went from ignoring every cue to being laser focused during training sessions, excelling in obedience, and growing into the sweetest pup.

We are so grateful that Lori has been part of both our dogs’ journeys. Her skill, patience, and support have been truly invaluable, and we cannot recommend her enough.",2025-08-14 10:59:57,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJySNfMMisflTAZe4QTLoNPfYd2_muxtchQNU1UQQzgdJ2ZWQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:15:30.794006,,

Pawsitive Practice Training & Behavior Consulting,(448) 288-7698,ChIJr5DBrA2c9YgRrpcHQoSk-Ag,Bonnie Trotter,5,"We rescued an 18 month old Australian Cattle Dog/ German Shepherd/ Pit Bull mix in January of 2022. When we rescued her we had no idea of the extent of her issues but they became apparent very quickly. While she is extremely smart, she is also very reactive, fear aggressive and exhibits a great deal of anxiety. My husband could not really go near her or pet her without her growling at him and showing her teeth. We had no idea how to help her and I even had a vet suggest that we euthanize her because she was beyond help. That wasn't going to happen so I started researching behavior training and behavior training facilities. I read so many great reviews for Pawsitive Practice so I contacted them. I cannot begin to express how incredibly grateful I am for Pawsitive Practice and especially for Tyler.

Tyler possesses a wealth of knowledge when it comes to dog behavior and training. He was able to recommend a Veterinarian who was also very knowledgeable regarding behavior issues in dogs and using medications to help with reactiveness and anxiety. We got Ari on a medication regimen and booked a 5 session training with Tyler. I am not exaggerating when I say that because of Tyler and the medication Ari is a completely different dog today.

It was so wonderful to witness the bond that developed between Tyler and Ari. She doesn't trust easily yet she would get so excited every time she saw him. He had so many great suggestions as far as resource materials and books that would be helpful. He showed us how to redirect her when needed, how to use positive reinforcement to get her to do what we wanted her to do and how to build trust with her. She still has a ways to go, but she is miles from where she started and we now have the tools needed to continue to train her and help her to become the best dog that she can be.

It is very evident that Tyler truly cares about the dogs that he helps train. He would call weekly to check on Ari and ask how she was doing or to give me some recommendations on things to try. He sent me some articles that he came across that he felt would be helpful and even took time to come to a couple of her vet visits. He far exceeded any expectations that I had regarding training and Ari and I will be forever grateful for the help he was able to provide.",2023-05-02 18:43:16,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXk2BnZzXe7YSRqeypVW1qrVfLAVzmtX_rQhvEzaSO6fiA_m4VACA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:31.382164,,
Pawsitive Practice Training & Behavior Consulting,(448) 288-7698,ChIJr5DBrA2c9YgRrpcHQoSk-Ag,Sarah Bowers,5,"Lisa was amazing with our 6-year old rescue who came to us displaying anxiety, some fear aggression, and limited basic training. The main problem areas we wanted to address were: lunging and snarling at cars or people that passed us on walks and also growling/snapping at new visitors that would come to the house. We signed up for a 5-session package. After a couple sessions, Lisa advised us to speak with our vet to find a medication to help calm her anxiety. I'm so glad we did! When we combined the medication along with Lisa's training techniques we have been able to achieve a much happier, responsive, calm, and self confident dog.

As a trainer, Lisa is patient and effusively positive. She's all about the love and treats. She was very knowledgeable and always explained the reasoning behind the various techniques and how to effectively employ them.

Piper had been a part of our family for 2 years when my son moved out, taking his dog, Audrey, with him. Audrey was Piper’s BFF and, unknown to us, her calming factor. We’d known that Piper was an anxious dog but it’s severity surfaced with Audrey out of the picture. It was when Piper destroyed the kitchen door moldings and doorknob that we knew we needed more help than medication could provide. I thought the situation was hopeless and those fears were reinforced when I spoke with a trainer who said Piper’s problems were out of his league. He referred me to Lisa Matthews. I wasn’t very optimistic, but as soon as I explained what we were going through with Piper, Lisa put together a plan of action with amazing results. She was Piper’s saving grace.  Today, we have routines in place and Piper knows that she can handle being alone.

Lisa also helped with Piper’s leash frustration. I was terrified to take this 85-pound baby on a walk.

After the visit, Diane has been in contact with me to ensure everything is going as expected and was available via text when I had follow up questions.

What really impressed me was the convenience and personalized care. No crowded waiting rooms, no stressful car rides—just professional, high-quality veterinary service delivered right to our doorstep. She was communicative and always on time, allowing us to continue our normal daily activities.

The 1:1 training is something everyone should experience. Andrea’s holistic approach to assessing the entire body and identifying the root causes of any issues is remarkable. She provides tangible exercises and stretches that truly make a difference. After two C-sections, I was experiencing back pain, but thanks to Andrea, the pain has subsided. I’m now more aware of my movements when working out and running, and I have the skills and stretches to maintain my progress on my own.

The group workouts are equally impressive. The small group size is perfect, and the complex exercises are both challenging and enjoyable. Andrea’s guidance and corrections on form are incredibly helpful, making each session highly effective.

Peak Movement Physical Therapy,(850) 228-1305,ChIJqRLBgBLxwogRCzR7ryGyIKQ,Betty Lou Lewis,5,"In June of 2024, I had a robotic pelvic floor lift surgery, 5 hours long.
The surgery was successful BUT I was left with urinary incontinence, which was not a problem prior to surgery.  The solution offered by the surgeon was to wear a pessary or to have surgery again to fix the problem……I was now wearing diapers 24/7.
A friend referred me to Dr Andrea Higgins, a Dr of physiotherapy, who specializes in Pelvic issues.  I had my assessment with her, the 3rd week of August. She was empathetic, gentle and thorough…and said that I had only 5% contraction strength of my pelvic floor muscles; no wonder that I was leaking when I walked, sat, turned in bed, or tried to exercise.  I  couldn’t even drive the car.  I never wanted to leave the house, and the diapers were humiliating for such an active person as myself. No one was invited over to the house…. I felt like a prisoner of my own body.
At my first session, I told Dr Andrea that my husband was planning a cruise for us to take in January; I asked her how much improvement she thought that I would have by then, after 10 sessions that I had booked with her. She replied with her laid-back S. Carolina accent, that I’d be pretty much normal.
Her studio is fully equipped with exercise balls, resistance bands and weights….super clean….very private and she makes you feel valued and comfortable right from the beginning. Each 75 minute session included testing my pelvic muscle strength, and working with me to learn various exercises for strengthening my entire pelvic and abdominal core. These were NOT your Grandma’s KEGELS!!  Designed to strengthen the glutes, thighs, abdomen and internal muscles….to make a tight band around your mid-section…this was homework which I gladly did. At times, Dr Andrea used other modalities, depending on what was needed that day…cupping, massage, etc.
I graduated to overnight pads, for day and night. My confidence was coming back….and what a relief to go shopping or dine out, and not have to run to the restroom when I  arrived and before I left.
During my final session, before the cruise, Dr Andrea said that I had attained 95-98% of pelvic muscle strength!!
Dr Andrea Higgins truly is a miracle worker- a gifted therapist who listens with her heart, and works with her sizable IQ and healing hands to restore women (and men) to their best selves. ( she also works virtually with  clients who cannot meet in person).  She has a new baby herself, and works wonders with new moms both pre and post pregnancy, with natural methods.

I read all of the negative reviews before making an appointment,  but since there isn't a lot of options I tried them anyway. I had an appointment made in advance, drove an hour to get there only for them to refuse to let my son see Dr. Liu.  This was a simple case trying to figure out what we could do for my toddler who wasn't talking.  Because the appointment was so far out I was able to see a neuropsychologist shortly before and I provided the results. Neither myself, the pediatrician, or my sons SLP agreed with the diagnosis and suggested to still see Dr. Liu.  After waiting in the office and paying for the visit, they took my son back for height and weight and then sent us out in the waiting room again.  I was then called back 3 times later for stupid questions.  The assistant that I was dealing with had her back to me for most of the conversations except when she turned around to make a face at me like I was the dumbest person on earth. She asked what I wanted out of the appointment and I told her I wanted to see what we could do to try to get my son some help. She informed me there's nothing I can do.  She conti used to question me and I politely told her I would prefer to tell the doctor instead since the entire waiting room could hear our conversation.  My husband and kids were in the waiting room. Finally, on the 4th t time they called me up they told me the Dr wouldn't see my son because I had already seen the neuropsychologist.  I had to ask for my money back since I had already paid and had been waiting 40 minutes after an hours drive there.  They said the paperwork I submitted was much more extensive than what Dr. Liu would do and he wanted to look over it and would reschedule. It has been over a month later and no one has bothered to do anything except send me a message that I missed the appointment.  I have no desire to ever go back anyway and hope future potential patients read this and stay away. After. Hours drive back, we went immediately to our pediatrician and told them what happened so they can avoid referring anyone else to Dr. Liu in the future.  Our pediatrician is wonderful and was so embarrassed that any pediatric Dr or their staff would act like this.

We switched to Liu after changing insurance, and in less than a year we are switching back. Liu was only able to see my son through telehealth. Our most recent appointment was scheduled months in advance, and at some point I received notification that the appointment we had tried to schedule in-person was suddenly moved to telehealth. I called and attempted to reschedule it in-person, and was then told he no longer goes to the PSL office, so I kept the original telehealth appointment. After pulling my son from his therapies and routines for yesterday, I was informed, after the fact, that he was no longer available for our telehealth appointment. I am not sure who's error this was but it is extremely unprofessional. I am inclined to believe it was the office's as a manager then later falsely told me they tried telling me of this change, Liu no longer being available telehealth or otherwise, on a certain date when they most certainly did not (no phone call records, text, email, voicemails on the date given). Someone was clearly covering or made a note that they contacted us, and then didn't. All our contact info has stayed the same.

I am appalled after almost 4 years of my daughter going here I’ve had such a HORRIBLE experience with all administrative management and workers.
The rudeness and pure laziness at the Port St. Lucie office is sickening. These are children we are dealing with!
This office has continuously given me misleading information which seems to be dependent on if they want to put in the extra work or conversation or not. Which it seems they don’t.
I had an appt today that was canceled because I was called “combative” after I was called 4 times just this morning regarding my appt. I’m
I have done telemedicine before plenty of times and was told I can’t anymore because my insurance isn’t paying for it. I said okay. They called yesterday telling me they got permission to do the telemedicine as the insurance WILL pay for it. (Florida blue primary and Medicaid secondary)
I could not attend a telemedicine that day as my child was in school and I was at work and they offered me a 1:15 slot. I then proceeded to ask if I could do telemedicine rather than my in person appt today they said they would call me back never called back. So I proceeded to call this morning to clarify. I was met with rudeness and misinformation multiple times. First it was yes I can do the telemedicine and then it was no I couldn’t then it was yes I could then it was no I couldn’t. Meanwhile this whole time I’m at work telling my boss yes then no then yes then no. How embarrassing and unprofessional. At this point I’m frustrated as anyone would be so I let them know it. Do you not understand you’ve had me on hold you’ve interrupted my work morning, with misinformation multiple times. So I told them to get it together this should not be happening. Since they didn’t like that or even like to listen to my situation the “administrative manager” Rosa HUNG UP on me and told me she would be canceling my appt as I am the stepmother of my child and I were to have the biological parent call. 1. MY child’s biological mother isn’t here and her father works. The entire time I, as LEGAL guardian, have gone to every single appt done every single sheet of paperwork and will not be dismissed. So I call back to also try to explain that. Was met with another lady “office manager of 25 years” who was extremely rude! Wouldn’t let me inquire what changed with insurances. She wouldn’t explain things to me nor did she give me her name. She too canceled my appt for a second time because I was asking questions. Back story I’ve previously had to do a coordination of benefits to show that Florida blue was primary and medicaid secondary. I asked if Florida blue was paying for the visits why does it matter that Medicaid doesn’t cover the telemedicine? She said because they don’t know whether Medicaid or Florida blue will be primary so I said isn’t that what the coordination of benefits is for? She immediately dismissed me saying basically that’s it Medicaid isn’t going to pay so I can’t do it and she’s canceling me again. At this point I am LIVID my daughter has been out of medicine for over a month because only one or few doctors travel to PSL and apparently only at certain times now. So as I’ve been waiting for this my child sits out of school in the back of my office, yes I am PISSED!
I don’t care that they dismiss me from the practice I’d never step foot back in that building. Which is a shame because I love Alyssa and I think she is a great physician!

Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

My wife and I had an eight-month experience with Pediatric Therapy Associates (PTA) for my daughter's speech therapy needs, and unfortunately, I must express our disappointment with the services provided. While the staff appeared friendly and accommodating at first, our overall experience left much to be desired.

Firstly, we we’re disheartened to discover that PTA did not allow parents to observe therapy sessions. As a concerned parent, we had hoped to actively participate in our daughter's progress by understanding the techniques used and learning how I could support her at home. However, PTA deemed this time as ""me time"" and denied our request. This lack of transparency and involvement left us feeling disconnected from our daughter's therapy journey.

Furthermore, despite the considerable time and financial investment we made at PTA, my daughter showed no significant progress in her speech development during the eight months of therapy. It became evident that the approach used by PTA was not effective for our child's needs. This realization left me frustrated and concerned about the quality of care she was receiving.

In an attempt to find better alternatives, we decided to switch to another therapy center that allowed parental observation and involvement in the sessions. To our relief, the change made a remarkable difference in my daughter's progress. Within just one month at the new center, she showed significant improvement, which was a clear contrast to her lack of progress at PTA.

Adding to my dissatisfaction, PTA has  sent us an exorbitant bill of $960.00. Considering the lack of progress and the restricted access to observe the therapy sessions, it feels as if we were merely paying for a babysitting service rather than effective speech therapy. This unexpected financial burden has added insult to injury and further solidified my negative experience with PTA.

In conclusion, my experience with Pediatric Therapy Associates has been disappointing overall. The lack of transparency, limited parental involvement, and the absence of significant progress in my daughter's speech development make it difficult for me to recommend their services. The substantial bill we received for what seemed like a minimal impact on my child's progress only served to exacerbate my dissatisfaction. As a concerned parent, I strongly advise others to explore alternative therapy centers that prioritize open communication and active parental involvement in their child's therapy sessions.",2023-07-24 21:33:13,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU4hGxnL9Mdq4t6eHL2G5ITUAAM8pkymerH9gp80G-qW8D5jqPW=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:43.579548,,

He has global developmental delay so receives speech, occupational and physiotherapy. The therapist are friendly, kind, and you can see that they genuinely love kids. My son looked forward to being there everyday! His therapy activities were structured in such a way that he had fun while doing them. Plus they have so much great equipment! Each time we return there is always something new that grabs his interest.  Because of PTA I have hope that he'll learn to walk and improve his communication skills.
Nancy is the best physiotherapist I have met, she pays keen attention to small but important details and is so interactive with the kids, my son loves her!
Monica his speech therapist is also a gem. I have literally watched his attending and communication skills evolve before my eyes.
Alyssa his occupational therapist has literally sold me on the benefits of OT. He's now so motivated to do things himself. They truly are the best.

Since the first session we have been treated so well by PTS. The therapists for our son have been AMAZING to him, so caring towards our family and have really invested themselves in us. They have been so patient, so gracious, so kind. For many years we had the same therapists for our son’s OT, PT and Speech. Talk about amazing consistency. They loved having me or my wife sit in on the sessions and participate, or stay more hands off as each session allowed. The therapists always make time to talk with us about our son’s progress or see how the family is doing. Our son has older siblings that care about his progress, and we were even able to bring our other children in one at a time to see our son in his sessions and even participate in his therapy, which is amazing.

The office and admin team have also been amazing – from all the crazy scheduling and rescheduling requests we’ve made to dealing with insurance and resolving those issues.

They keep a mediocre records of payments. I have 3+ years of experience between 2 kids with them and I had 3 separate issues where they asked for more money for ""missing visit payments"". It is ridiculous. They even use the same script every time ""We are doing a cleanup and discover that some visits do not have payments records attached"". Really? At the same time, their policy is to pay for the visit before the kids go back for service. How the kid got therapy that day if no payment was done?

My last visit was last year and up to today they keep making up visits for missing payments. This is the 3rd time this happens between 2 kids. To make it even worse, they NOW (yes, few months ago) have a ""billing manager"" (her name is Taylor - not a friendly one) which is nothing less than calling out customers liars because she can only rely on their very own inefficient payments records that got them here in the first place. A real financial disaster, a business with no operations whatsoever. Now, our kids therapist (Becca) is a keeper. Lovely, passionate, and professional.

Pediatric Therapy Services,(863) 802-3800,ChIJLbcKpkc_3YgRFV67PEwmyZ8,stephanie switzer,1,I feel like my daughter was just a number at this office. She was tossed around to more therapists in the 7 months she was there. We moved from south Florida and there she was receiving 3 hours a week of speech and 3 hours a week for OT. When I finally got her a appt for OT I had to keep calling because they never called me to tell me she was up next on their wait list. Speech however took longer to get a spot. So OT they evaluated her in July 2024. She stated she will need 2- 30 min sessions a week which is super drastic from what she had only a few months prior in Miami. I agreed and then from July to March 2 therapists left and my daughter each time in limbo with no OT. Then when they did the re evaluation the ot never spoke to me as to why they moved her to 1-30 min sessions a week.i asked to speak to the ot and the next day they sent the speech therapist. Who also told me they bumped her to 1 30 min session as well.i asked why and she told me she doesn’t know that my daughter is 7 months below her age. When I asked for a second opinion they wouldn’t give me one. I also did not like that every time my daughter came for a session she had a different therapist and most times it was just a temporary therapist because the one assigned to her was out or left. How can my daughter progress if she does not have a stable relationship with her therapist. How can she trust them if she doesn’t know them? When I told the front desk person she didn’t care and just looked at me like I was crazy. So I told her to cancel all her appointments and I’ll go elsewhere. Now I’m in limbo again because my daughter won’t have the services she needs. Oh and for them stating it is a insurance issue as to why they won’t give her more then 1-2 30 min sessions a week sis a lie I spoke to my daughters case worker who said it isn’t true and she qualifies for more.

Pediatric Therapy of Riverside,(904) 300-0796,ChIJg_6xd2K35YgRfOp8RkquRm0,Ashley Abeles,5,"Bridget is the best of the best, and her services have been an invaluable investment for our family!  As a mom and experienced special educator/early intervention provider, I can be a tough critic when it comes to therapists.  My standards are high because I understand that not all therapists are created equal and that the skill level and dedication of a therapist will have direct impacts on how (or if) a child progresses.  When one of my own children presented with mild speech and expressive language delays, I began my search for a highly-qualified therapist.  From the first time I met Bridget, she exceeded my expectations!  Some previous professionals had difficulty identifying my son’s needs, but Bridget intuitively understood where he needed support and how to provide it.  Upon initiating services with Bridget, my son immediately began to make progress; teachers, family members, and friends all commented on his improved language and intelligibility.  Bridget spent time at the end of each session discussing what they had worked on and how we could carry over those skills at home.  This was key in allowing us to maximize his learning opportunities and generalize skills across people and environments.  After approximately two years of services, my son has made immense progress and, as a result, now demonstrates increased confidence and reduced interfering behavior.  In fact, his progress has been so significant that he no longer needs weekly speech sessions.  While we are so sad to discontinue services (because we adore Bridget!), we are also grateful to be at a point where we are comfortable with that decision.  When a child makes so much progress that services are no longer necessary, that is the ultimate evidence of a fantastic therapist and a job well-done!  Bridget is warm, dedicated, knowledgeable, creative, and consistently professional.  I recommend her services without hesitation!",2020-10-20 19:38:59,4 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX5HqPzXcSLXGyDQDQMH8YzRW2VGYm2Np4uOHi30qw4YoKMp-3E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:47.592020,,

Pet Angel Memorial Center,(239) 936-1732,ChIJK-gwqAdA24gRQJd4n4NDKQs,N R,1,"I was so happy to find this place last year when I lost my kitty who was 17 years old. It was very tough because so many places were not allowing you to come in with your pet because of Covid. They were the only ones gracious enough to allow me to stay with her through the whole process. I will forever be grateful and they are very good people I would highly recommend.  Katherine was the lady who took care of us.

Update….her daughter passed last year from kidney disease sadly,  and we brought her here as well. Very caring, sweet people.

Last Update; September 4, 2024   I just lost my baby girl who was soon to be 22 years old. Catherine was the lady who worked with me years back. She is sadly no longer there. The new girl really didn’t care  much she  barely got out of her seat from behind the computer. Seemed very apathetic. I would not go back now that Catherine ‘s not there. She didn’t show much care concern at all. Just asked which urn  I wanted,  basically was it, and took my credit card.  After she took my credit card I had to ask if I could have a couple moments alone with my baby girl and maybe some privacy. Otherwise I guess she just would’ve said bye and closed the door.

She agreed but seemed very surprised that I would ask something like that. I’m sure a lot of people do. And they should offer. Then I had to ask for my blanket back since I wanted to keep something that had her scent, and she just kind of stood there and I said well can you wrap her in one of your blankets and she still kind of stood there just a very awkward interaction. She needs more sympathy training.  And  to get out from behind her computer and actually interact with people who have just lost their fur child.  It’s a very sensitive time and it might just be another customer to her but for the fur parent, it’s the loss of a family member. At least OFFER some quiet time and a private place to say a final farewell.  The customer shouldn't have to ASK. When I picked  up my baby’s remains, just a bag. I had to ASK to see the urn and paw print. They’re emotionless.  No care whatsoever.  ASK your  customers if they’d like to see the urn they just paid for instead of rushing them out. Never again.

The least they could have done was get the memorial items right. I wanted 2 paw prints and we discussed in office that I wanted 1 of them for a tattoo. Both paw prints(which cost $62.00) were in my opinion too smudged for a tattoo. My dog had an extra toe which made it unique and I could not even tell in the print. Of course All of their sample prints advertised in their office looked perfect though. The dogs coming in are unable to move or fight the process so there should be NO reason they can not get a good print unless they are rushing. I also asked for some ashes to be set aside for a charm I bought elsewhere. When I got there to pick up they had forgotten. She had to take him to the back to get me some. When I got home the amount she set aside was not even enough for my charm. So in my grieving process I had to open my baby's ashes and go thru them myself. Nobody should have to do that while grieving!! I am very dissatisfied and disappointed at the whole process at this point!! These are all memorial items that I can not get back! They did reach out and said they would ""try"" to make this situation right but of course a week has gone by and I've heard nothing. At this point I feel like they are blowing off the situation. They did ask me to take my review down which I did and now i have gone from sad to pissed so I am reposting. The passing of a fur baby should not be this aggravating especially when it is already an emotional process. Everyone's baby deserves the best in their passing. I will definitely be doing something else in the future if needed",2025-09-22 05:15:28,3 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK_P2sJUsLu-MIs3Ulz2Mw_SodPoZrlLnNq19yTDL0bkTPjnw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:15:54.570020,,

I got my girl back in her wooden box I selected and it was packaged carefully in a blue velvet bag. Savannah was the staff member I interacted with and she was so kind and compassionate, even the tone in which she spoke was incredibly gentle.

Last year I knew I was going to have to deal with Lucky's passing, so I did a little research on crematories in the area. I met with Hilary Vessels of Paw Prints Pet Crematory and discussed the basic info regarding the services provided. It was because of Hilary's compassionate discussion I decided to use Paw Prints.

Lucky passed on a Friday and Paw Prints arranged for one of their vans to pick her up on Monday. I received a call on Tuesday informing me Lucky was ready to come home.

Arriving at Paw Prints, by chance, I was greeted by one of the owners, Nate Ferguson. He was very polite and truly compassionate. When bringing out Lucky I was pleasantly surprised. She was handed to me in a custom made fabric carrying bag. As I informed them I was awaiting delivery of an Urn, they provided a very nice complementary wooden container. Also provided was a clipping of Lucky's hair, A paper heart with wildflower seeds for planting, a prayer, a poem and a sympathy note from Paw Prints.

Nate took some extra time to ask me about Lucky. It helped to have someone listen, the owners and the staff do that very well!

I am very thankful and comforted to know that Lucky's final journey was provided by the loving family of Paw Prints Pet Crematory.

We had taken our sweet toy Yorkie, Gigi, to another cancer center down south and she was newly diagnosed.  It was a horrible experience.  She had three treatments and we were only ""allowed"" to see the vet oncologist once.  He never gave us an update after the initial consultation and he was very negative from the start of her lymphoma treatment.  Their team was also so rude.  So we decided to make the move to Pet Cancer Group.   It was a great decision.  Dr. Villamil was so caring with our Gigi and the staff was always cheerful, kind and very professional.  Dr. Villamil came out to talk to us about her labs and check up each and every time .  We didn't think that she would be able to tolerate her treatment for very long so we braced ourselves.  However under Dr. Villamil's care, she lived well beyond what was expected (over two years).  Sadly, we lost our Gigi a couple of months ago but we have only positive things to say about the doctor and his staff.  They were a blessing to us and our fur girl.

We met with Dr Villamil and chose to begin chemotherapy based on the prognosis. Dr Villamil gave us hope of “80% remission with 4-5 years of life after treatment”. We started chemotherapy in April. In August, the day of Bruce’s last chemo treatment, we called to inform them that Bruce had taken a sudden and drastic decline and was being seen as an emergency at his vet. I called Dr Villamil to advise them of the situation and all they said to me was “I’ll let the doctor know”. No other words. We had to euthanize our sweet boy Bruce the next day.  We were heartbroken. It’s been almost 3 months since and they have never contacted me since about Bruce, his status or if we were even coming back, to reschedule, etc. They have never reached out to us or followed up. We lost our fur baby 4 months unexpectedly after beginning treatment. We knew that is a risk you take with chemo treatment. But the absolute lack of compassion, sympathy, care, follow-up is very upsetting. You feel like a dollar sign and just a number.

Wendy was able to inform us why Mocha was acting the way she was, and offered a ""train away"" program where Mocha stayed with Wendy at Haines Road Animal Hospital for a week. During this time, Mocha trained daily 1x1 with Wendy. At the end of the program, Mocha came back to us a changed dog!

She got the main vet, Mr. Garcia, on the phone right away, and he guided me through what to do before I even arrived. When I got to the office, Mr. Garcia came running into the lobby the moment he heard someone walked in, It just shows how genuinely attentive and dedicated he is to helping pets in emergencies.

The whole team was compassionate, fast, and professional. They treated my dog with urgency and care, and their pricing was completely fair for the level of service I received.

Our girl had been seen at her primary vet and we had an X-ray scheduled. We ended up needing to take her for an emergency X-ray and found a place near our home. After sitting there for 20-30 minutes, we got online to find a different place. We found PURE and our girl was taken back and X-rays and ultrasounds were done almost immediately after getting there. We ended up moving forward to remove a large mass in her abdomen. We live about 40 minutes away so by the time we got home and just about situated, we got a call from Dr. Curro saying once they opened her up and assessed, they determined the mass was too large and other organs were too greatly involved. We made our way back to say our final goodbyes to our sweet Nova. All the staff were amazing, making sure they answered any question we had and repeating answers because it was an emotionally tough time for us so it was hard to retain some of what we had been told. They put us in a cozy room where we all gave loves to our sweet pup and spent her final moments with her. They supplied treats and water for our girl. They had snacks in the room for the families. I’m so glad we didn’t have to say goodbye in a sterile exam room. They gave us all the time we needed, they didn’t rush us at all.

He’s an orange tabby and he likes to get into things and eat stuff he’s not supposed to. I had to bring him in twice to induce vomiting, but the second time I had to leave him overnight because he ate chocolate, which he basically poisoned himself. My overall experience with this emergency vet being a first time, pet owner myself Is definitely good reviews only. Everyone in the vet is very nice and definitely emotionally understanding. I felt like I called other vet emergency rooms and they were just trying to have me rush my cat in there just to get checked Just to bring him in to do it. Meanwhile, here they were definitely more understanding of how I was feeling as well. Every vet in there is very informative and they do go above and beyond to make sure that  Your pet is OK. In addition, even though I did leave them over for one night, I was allowed to go visit him at any time.  They even gave  me advice as a first time pet owner as to certain reasons as to why my cat eats ravenously. And they took the time to put me in the right direction And even told me some things, I didn’t know about cats that I thought I knew.  Both times I took him to the vet ER he came back home And that’s all that matters. As far as the vet bill I felt like their prices are decently reasonable Although it could get expensive They have a payment plan and I feel like that alone should help a lot of people because not everyone can get approved for a care credit.

Pet Wellness Center LLC,(239) 454-7387,ChIJg9fw9NQ-24gR_Xk6ZX4RQl4,kaitlyn jacobs,5,"I recently visited Pet Wellness Center, LLC in Fort Myers with my 10-year-old Persian cat, Jigglypuff, and had an experience that truly exceeded all expectations. As an NP student studying holistic medicine, I have grown increasingly disillusioned with traditional Western medicine for both humans and animals. Discovering a holistic veterinary practice just 12 minutes from my home felt like a blessing.

Dr. Ramirez's warmth and compassion were evident from the moment we walked in. She was genuinely moved by Jigglypuff, even shedding tears as she called him a ""human in cat form."" Her words resonated deeply with me, as Jigglypuff is my soulmate and means the world to me. Dr. Ramirez observed that Jigglypuff had the lowest heart rate she had ever encountered in her practice, describing him as ""zen."" It was wonderful to see someone else appreciate his unique spirit and calm nature as much as I do.

Dr. Ramirez's approach was the epitome of holistic care. She focused on Jigglypuff as a whole being rather than just a set of symptoms, which is what I believe medicine should be. Her examination was thorough, and her calming energy was evident in every word and action. Unlike traditional vets who often rush to invasive treatments, she emphasized understanding and treating the entire body. Instead of recommending x-rays, vaccinations, or invasive treatments, she suggested a homeopathic remedy, a vial of Thuja, for Jigglypuff's occasional itchy skin.

Jigglypuff adored Dr. Ramirez, offering her eye kisses and allowing her to hold him throughout our visit. I was once told by a pet psychic to watch how Jigglypuff reacts to new people, and his immediate affection for Dr. Ramirez speaks volumes about her loving energy. I wholeheartedly recommend Pet Wellness Center, LLC to anyone considering a shift from traditional to holistic medicine, whether for their pets or themselves. Dr. Ramirez is a rare gem, radiating spiritual and loving energy that is hard to find, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have found her.",2024-07-23 16:01:48,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXEr5arLhlPEOOGr_pgOsorKmiwBMLzUgdUOt01KC7pLUxhwpUK=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:59.499479,,

I recently relocated to the U.S. after extensive shoulder surgery, and the PT Group of Florida was my first physical therapy experience here — there’s no looking back! They are truly outstanding at what they do.

I’ve had many injuries throughout my life, so I know how important good PT is. The team takes time to listen, guide, and push — all in a balanced and supportive way. They also have a great app that reminds you to do your exercises and includes videos for each one, so you never forget the proper form.

Angie, Ariel, and Anthony are amazing physical therapists — knowledgeable, caring, and motivating. I’d recommend any of them without hesitation!  Joan, who handles scheduling, insurance, and billing, is a pleasure to work with — efficient, kind, and always helpful.

Of the non-hospital affiliated centers, I can state without reservations that PT Now is significantly superior to my experience elsewhere.

The physical therapy assistants I work with for the therapy are both licensed by the Florida DOH. They are very skilled, personable, take extra efforts to watch for patients' safety, and they are always keeping an eye on you to make sure you're performing the exercises correctly (this is something I did not find it the other centers I had been to in the past).

I went November of 2024.  Because the front desk let me know I had zero copay I figured why not go as many times as my doctor prescribed. So I tried going 2 to 3 times a week. I made sure to ask each and every time if I had anything due to make sure I was good.  After the 8th visit the front desk person called me at hime and asked me to call the insurance provider that there is something going on that I would need to call them.  Normally I never call my own insurance company so I was confused.  He said just said call them, they will let you know whats going on.  And now they said yeah you had a copay each time.  I asked every time and the front desk said I didn't owe him anything.  Had I known this I wouldn't have gone more then the first time.  So now the Physical therapy place wants to charge me everything from the beginning.  I feel like they deliberately kept me waiting to accumulate charges.  When I go to any doctors office they always tell me my copay before I even go inside and have me pay.  I feel like I was scammed and this is an awful practice.

I’ve been training for over 20 years and have worked with no fewer than a dozen physical therapists during that time. Jesse stands out as the most creative, knowledgeable, and effective PT I’ve ever worked with.

He seamlessly blends traditional therapy with advanced techniques like Graston, cupping, dry needling, and adjustments—always knowing exactly how to address pain so it never slowed down our progress. His ability to tailor the program to my needs while pushing me further than I thought possible has been life-changing.

His knowledge and expertise are amazing!! He listened, looked and carefully diagnosed me. I had been suffering with frozen shoulder for almost a year before I found Dr. Jesse who was at a posing clinic that I attended at my gym. He clearly explained everything, and created a successful program for rehabilitation, with the goal of getting me rehabilitated, so that I could graduate from PT with success.

He very literally saved me. Without him I never would have been able to continue training for my fitness show, nor continued prep for another as I am now. The sky is the limit thanks to him!  I had gone to physical therapy two separate tries in that year with no relief or success and I felt like iI was in a cue working on my own while they worked with many other clients at the same time and so after weeks without progress I gave up.

Dr. Jesse works one on one with me each session and focuses fully on our progress each time. He explqins everything,  asks questions and always utilizes the full sessions, & sometimes beyond if it was beneficial to progress made during the session. He is extremely knowledgeable, genuinely cares and wants to get you all possible recovery both for maximum range of motion and relief from any pain its causing. He truly is brilliant, friendly, and patient.

When you see Gabe Pardo, the incredible physical therapist, you see a big smile and are addressed by your name. He has a magical personal touch, literally and figuratively, that makes you feel great. He listens and caters his manual therapy and exercises to your particular pain/need. He creates a personal program and takes notes to best help you as you heal and reach your goals. He adjusts according to your needs.
There is a well-equipped gym at the facility which helps with strengthening and conditioning. Brandon is another PT there that assists with therapy as well as exercises. He watches you, corrects your form and explains the reasoning behind the why. Brandon is great. They all work amazingly together, supporting each other to help all of their clients get the attention and help they need. No wonder every client is happy and excited to go there.

The staff here is very approachable and knowledgeable. I decided to stay for additional training last year and highly recommend this place for everything from healing a sports injury to optimizing your form and technique.

It’s important to note the owner, Ron, and many of the staff here have been here a long time and demonstrate a commitment to excellence every day.

Here are my top reasons for someone to come here:

1. You’ve trained for years and can’t seem to make significant improvements.

2. You are coming back to training after rehab and are fearful of reinjuring yourself.

3. You or your children want to learn a healthy approach to working out for physique, health, etc… without the risk of injury or ego driven decisions.

After posting my initial review, I was able to get a call and schedule not just one, but two injection procedures. Dr. Pohlman has been incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely listened to my concerns. He’s actively helping me find the best path forward with my back issues, which I deeply appreciate.

I’ve now visited both the Pompano and Delray offices, and each time I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the communication and scheduling process was. At the Coral Springs office, Stef, one of the front desk assistants, has been consistently kind and communicative, which has made a huge difference in my experience.

I’m thankful that the communication issues I experienced before have been resolved, and I’m glad to now feel heard, respected, and properly cared for. Would definitely recommend Dr. Pohlman and the clinic for future treatment!

7/26/2025: My first visit at this place was nice, Dr. McGuire listened to my concerns, and I was told to schedule an injection procedure. However, it has been over a month since then, and I’ve tried calling the clinic multiple times, left several voicemails, and even texted them with no response. They don’t respond to you, nor do they seem to care that a person is in need of a procedure to manage pain or improve their health.

Words cannot express the deep gratitude we have for Sonya Olsen, who has worked with our son for the past 2 years and helped him overcome childhood apraxia of speech. From the very beginning, Sonya brought not only unmatched expertise and dedication, but also warmth, patience, and encouragement when we needed it most.

Watching our son struggle to form words was heartbreaking, but Sonya gave us hope and a clear path forward. Through personalized strategies, consistent support, and tireless commitment, she helped our son find his voice—literally. The transformation we have witnessed is nothing short of extraordinary. Today, our son speaks with confidence, clarity, and joy, and it is thanks to Sonya’s relentless belief in his potential.

She didn’t just treat our child—Sonya empowered our entire family. We always felt heard, supported, and guided through every step of the journey. If you’re looking for a speech therapist who is compassionate, skilled, and truly devoted to changing lives, look no further than Sonya Olsen.

She is detail oriented and is an excellent observer in children behavior. Her accurate observation led to diagnosis of unrelated health problems in care of our son.
Our son loves working with Sonya and we have never had an issue with her or her office. She waited three months for our insurance authorization while having sessions with our son on a daily basis. Even after our suggestion to run the cost of the sessions through our credit card, she insisted on waiting for the insurance situation to clear.

As someone who used to manage a medical clinic there are a lot of red flags. Instead of re-billing Sonya told me to apply for a scholarship to help with funds... we have the scholarship that is besides the point this should have been 100% paid by insurance not my son's educational funds.

From the beginning with my 3 year old who was diagnosed with ASD level 3, when I first called and spoke directly to the owner Irene who was amazingly sweet and informative made me confident to begin this journey for my daughter. After that I got in touch with Cassie the BCBA and clinic director who basically held my hand through it all sent pictures to ease my mind as I was so scared and nervous to leave my baby girl anywhere inpatient without me there but I’m so glad I trusted these wonderful people because it’s been almost a year and my daughter has surpassed milestone after milestone she surprises us daily sky is the limit with the help of what’s now become a second family to my daughter and honestly my whole family she LOVES it there. A huge shout out to Jenna and Bry just a couple of the awesome RBTs there they care and have created such a bond with my girl they deserve so much recognition. I can go on and on but to wrap it up I have never had a single issue since the beginning every staff member I’ve come in contact with and witnessed interact with not only me and my family but all the other beautiful families who attend there have been extraordinary!

I know how scary this entire journey for all the parents and loved ones is but if I could give you this advice going with positive steps you will be happy and your loved one will be safe and grow into the amazing human they are inside and out.

Positive Steps ABA,(321) 477-3905,ChIJ2c7ovKkN3ogRmc5AS9edle8,Tiffany White,1,"It's rather upsetting that the owner stated she has no recollection of me as a previous client after I've personally spoken to and emailed her prior to my son being enrolled here.

His spot at this location was given to another child and we were informed that we'd be contacted when another spot had opened up.  They chose not to hold his spot while he was on vacation which is understandable, but what's upsetting is that this was not communicated to us so that we could make changes in our schedule to accommodate this policy. Months had gone by just for me to find out they had actually been accepting children again and just chose not to inform us. Irene ignored my husband's phone calls for weeks and would not return voicemails, so I decided to personally text his therapist to see what was going on.

With that being said, you may want to think twice if you want to take your child on a summer vacation prior to enrolling them here.

Nonetheless, I do still intend to reach out to the owner. Maybe there's a chance she knew nothing about this.",2024-04-30 14:48:35,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXw4ThT6va4qi47T7PuD39t_bZg32fEBChIfPb0YY1UbgGGhtQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:16:37.899224,,

Dr Mark is a master in the art of healing. His extensive training ( degrees in neurobiology and PT, doctorate in PT) and additional training with renowned Dr. Marano Rocabado explain his extensive knowledge.

But he is that rare combination of intellectual brilliance AND a tender, kind bedside manner.

He used a combination of targeted massage, gentle stretching, the best dry needling experience I have ever had. Instant relief!
He gave me simple techniques to do at home to promote circulation to the tissues.

An excellent diagnostition, after he examined me he explained why I was such a good candidate for having TMJ, gave practical advice on future more invasive treatments I was considering (that likely wouldn't help) and spoke in laymen's terms that I could understand.

Cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic brought me to JAX & triggered my TMJ but what a blessing that I found this practice and this healer!

This office exemplifies the way medical practices used to be: tight- knit, personal and caring. They handled my insurance quickly and respond immediately to set up future appointments.

Dr Mark even found a therapist near my home with similar credentials for me to see but I will continue to see Dr Mark whenever I'm in JAX for cancer appointments.

Premier Physical Therapy & Sports Medicine,(772) 464-6424,ChIJ35fRRpPx3ogRj5WAwrV2DGM,Red Peterson,5,"In late 2023 my knee replacement surgery was postponed for a year due to other health issues. I was hobbled with 2 bad knees and back pain. My family kept saying PT, PT and finally I looked into it. My brother (shoulder replacement) and my neighbor (knee replacement) both highly recommended Premier and I’m glad they did. Tara got me started on exercises for my core strength but when I had to change my start time Amanda took over and after several weeks of working with her and at home my back pain was gone and I was walking with a lot less pain.
In February after a knee replacement I came back to Premier. Amanda, with help from Joseph worked with me on my strength, balance, range of motion and pain management.
I can’t say enough about how much Amanda helped me during this time. Not only with the knowledge of her profession but also with her knowledge of people. Her kindness humor and support were greatly appreciated. Thanks Amanda and thanks to the rest of crew at Premier. Tara, Joseph, Stephanie and Fred.
I salute all of you for the important work that you do helping people like me to live their lives stronger and pain free. Thanks guys!

We had initially taken my cat Pumpkin to another veterinarian because they were cheap and affordable. However, we paid the price in the long run because Pumpkin was misdiagnosed at that vet, and also given a long-lasting steroid injection which had caused her to ultimately be hospitalized there after reacting to it. Fast forward a few weeks and the original concern had returned for my cat. I scheduled Dr. Hefter to arrive at our house and the appointment could not have been easier! He was so wonderful to work with and speak to, the communication with him and his team was very quick and they were overall a joy to work with.

I got hit by a car in July last year and it has been surprisingly challenging, especially as a professional dancer to find great quality treatment. My insurance is in NY so I've needed to be particular with paying out of pocket. In addition to noting the efficiency and quality of recovery (PS spends more time using customized manual therapy instead of just hooking me up to an EMS machine) - other places I tried had similar (or higher) prices but the PT works with different clients in the same hour. Here they are with you one-on-one the whole hour.

Eugene set me up with Lindsey who has been incredibly knowledgeable, encouraging and fun. I started going twice a week about a month ago. At that time, I was having a lot of difficulty sleeping every night, even with several painkillers. Which of course affects everything. This week I had the first string of days I've been able to sleep through the night without painkillers 🙏.

Prodigy Autism Center,(888) 489-1691,ChIJB7jUXN5754gR1Nm8Np68ig0,Timothy & Lorena Satnarain,1,"At enrollment of our kids, we discussed our concerns/importance of maintaining consistency with school and other therapies which lead to afternoon sessions daily and one day of early dismissal for one of our kids. Later, we learn that we would need to move to the facility’s new “block scheduling” or not receive services. This required daily early dismissal from school where other therapies were being received so coordination with the school was necessary prior to this switch. Admin states that we did not agree to the new scheduling, which is true because I won’t risk their school attendance/placement. The school did not respond because of a hurricane and the county was shut down for days. Prodigy discontinued both kids’ therapy until we got approval and even though, despite the words of the admin, the kids’ spots were not held for them. Our kids went weeks without therapy.
Recently one of my kid’s days was eliminated with less than 24hr notice (coincidently the agreed upon early day), due to the unavailability of therapists for that day. Admin did call to speak on the changes the day of, but this was impromptu when I was at work and unable to fully discuss. A BCBA offered provide treatment, but Admin denied that idea and accommodation as “it is not feasible to hire a new therapist.” Therapists appeared to be reassigned to accommodate other clients, which we found to be preferential discrimination.
As an advocate for my kids, I did have multiple chats regarding this matter which was considered “aggressive behavior” with “defamatory remarks.” Admin claims that they have “gone above and beyond by accommodating extended absences and accommodating an egregious amount of untimely late pick-ups.” Medical notes were provided when applicable and emergencies/death are unavoidable. Also, if they want kids to be checked out on time, therapists should be ready at pickup time and parents not waiting outside to be let it past the session ending time. Being distracted by using a mobile device to check out kids is disrespectful during the verbal update provided at the end of session.
Though the contract states to be upheld to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts, we found this to be false in our experience, specifically noting Ethics Standards 2.02 Timeliness, 2.08 Communicating About Services, 3.01 Responsibility to Clients, 3.04 Service Agreement, 3.12 Advocating for Appropriate Services, 3.14 Facilitating Continuity of Services, 3.15 Appropriately Discontinuing Services, 3.16 Appropriately Transitioning Services.
IN MY OPINION: The administration of this company has effectively displayed the lack of clientele care and compassion for kids of special needs to grow and build life skill. As parents, we have looked past the screen time during sessions and the acceptance of aggressive behavior towards my kids (apparently, it’s a constant learning opportunity but not when your child does not feel safe). With this review, admin might find it apt to redirect our issues, HOWEVER, I am a MOM of kids who need someone to advocate for them. Deflecting the issues at hand does not justify what we experienced. Lasty, I did research many avenues to act on so that my kid’s services would be reinstated. Unfortunately, the admin cannot be held accountable to the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts (as listed in their contract) because they are not BCBAs. This negative experience brought us to find another company whose focus on routine, consistency, and overall patient first mindset better match our children’s needs and assisted in providing a seamless transition of services. It should be noted that the counselors do seem to genuinely care about their patients, but the same cannot be said for the admin team which ultimately led us to seek therapy elsewhere.",2023-05-10 16:13:26,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8QlzTYx6j97CBCDKhKLM1NTd9oSRPOQ_30pnUL9Sz1O6A2CmBWQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:17:00.988414,,

Whoever said you can’t teach an old dog new tricks clearly hasn’t met Alison! After our 10-year-old pup experienced a traumatic house fire, he was left with severe anxiety and reactivity issues. We were feeling hopeless, but then we found Alison, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous.

Alison employs a positive reinforcement approach, always prioritizing the well-being of the dogs in her care. Her gentle yet effective methods have transformed our anxious pup into a calmer, more confident companion. It’s been an absolute joy to witness his progress as he learns to navigate the world around him with newfound ease.

We also have a younger pup who has benefited tremendously from Alison’s training. Her consistent guidance has instilled a sense of control and discipline that has made a world of difference for both of our dogs.

We are primarily training our 2 year old female beagle; from basic manners, to more advanced safety commands like ""wait"", to tricks like ""shake"" and ""spin"". She's even accomplished to teach our senior beagles to sit and stay, which proves you can teach an old dog new tricks.

Allison is very positive, warm, and friendly, she will be very gentle and patient with your dog until they get it. While this is training for your dog, it's also training for the owner, making sure we feel comfortable and knowledgeable on carrying out commands with our dogs. Allison is even gentle on us humans, when we may be hard on ourselves.

Allison understands and recognizes each dog breed is different and will train specifically to your dog's breed. She knows beagles are more food driven than anything else, where another dog might live for toys, balls, or praise.

She comes to our home to make the dog feel comfortable and it makes it easier on us to learn, because there are less distractions in our own home.

I couldn’t be more grateful for the care, expertise, and support I received during my recovery process.
From my very first visit, I was impressed by the professionalism and warmth of the entire team. The staff made me feel comfortable right away, which was especially important after such significant surgeries.
My physical therapists were Natalie and Luis. They have been exceptional. They have taken the time to carefully assess my condition and listened to my concerns, making sure I understood each step of the rehabilitation plan. The treatment plan was personalized to my needs, with a focus on both my back and hip recovery. They both were patient, encouraging, and always ensured that I was progressing at a pace that was safe and effective for me. The front desk staff have also been superb. They are courteous, friendly and on top of scheduling appointments. The PT assistants and students that have rotated through the center have all been great.
What has stood out most during my therapy has been the genuine concern the team had for my well-being. They took the time to answer my questions and made sure I felt confident and capable throughout the process. I always felt like I was in good hands, and the results speak for themselves and although I am still in recovery mode, I am now walking, moving, and living with much less pain and far more strength than I ever imagined possible just a few months ago.
If you will be needing physical therapy and recovering from surgery or dealing with any type of physical limitation, I highly recommend Progressive Therapy.

I've had the pleasure of working with several PTs from Luis, to Oscar, and my all time favorite,  Natalie! They give challenging exercises that push you but nothing too painful that will discourage you as a patient.

It’s too bad there are only five stars because seven would be more like it! Our dog Coleman has been with Kris  ever since he was back on Rover. It’s absolutely amazing but the first time that Kris meets your dog and makes eye contact,  he is literally a dog whisperer. I could go on and on about what Kris taught us about our dog and how we have used these techniques in every day life. This review is about Pup Paradise and it is absolutely the best most reliable doggy daycare service and even extended stay for many clients. My wife and I both travel and we are absolutely totally at ease knowing our dog Coleman is going over to Pup Paradise under Kris’s supervision.  If you have not done a meet and greet with Kris yet, I encourage you to do so, and it will be your go to for the foreseeable future. Thank you, Kris for all you do for us and Coleman as he can’t wait to get back to your place to be with all his friends. A+++ And 7 stars!

I had been seeing a  therapist at advent health for months prior but had little to no progress. This is something I’ve been struggling with for around 4 years now. I wanted to try another perspective before giving up and found her online. In the few months I’ve worked with her, the care plan is much more personalized and not so black and white as it was with other therapists. Each visit/plan seems to be created on the spot based on how I was doing or feeling that week along with some structured things. I have been seeing her weekly for about 2-3 months and noticed tightness relief within the first month with other symptoms getting better in the later months. We were even able to stop with the dry needling in the later visits and still see improvement. She makes everything super comfortable and I really do wish I found out about her sooner. She is extremely knowledgeable and very nice. Not only am I doing the things to make myself feel better but in turn, am also learning why and how things are working. It can be super depressing not knowing what’s going on with your body.

Pursuit Physical Therapy,(407) 594-4297,ChIJfyPPJbRx54gRjq6UB0OOeqg,Jenn DeVitis,5,"Not long after getting into golf, I started experiencing back pain that was more than just beginner soreness. After reading positive reviews online I booked an evaluation with Pursuit Physical Therapy - and I’m so glad I did.

From the start, Dr. Michael Fabrick was thorough, patient, and knowledgeable. He didn’t just treat the pain - he identified the root cause, which turned out to be limited thoracic rotation. This allowed him to create a focused treatment plan that addressed both the immediate strain and the underlying issue, helping to prevent future injuries.

One of the things I appreciated most was the personalized home exercise program. Each week, Michael added new movements to increase my mobility and build strength at a steady, manageable pace.

After just four weeks of treatment, I’m back to swinging pain-free! I’m incredibly grateful for Michael’s expert care and highly recommend him to anyone dealing with pain or hoping to improve their physical performance.

The bad news might be that you need physical therapy - but the good news is, you’ll be in great hands with Pursuit Physical Therapy!

After suffering a fall and left with back and hip pain that left me barely able to sit comfortably, stand straight or walk without a cane, I was referred to MaryAnn at Pursuit Physical Therapy. Four months of agony that included six weeks of  PT with another local organization,  I finally found some relief after our FIRST session.  I was walking and near pain free after 4 visits. After completing more sessions to help strengthen the effected areas, I couldn’t be happier. Because of the success of treatment, I decided to have MaryAnn try working on my arm. This area has been in constant 24/7 pain from nerve damage almost 14 years ago.  After a little trial and error, MaryAnn found a combination of therapies that have helped reduce my daily pain levels from a consistent 8 to averaging between 5 and 6.  To me this is a HUGE change to my daily life.

She was able to help me overcome a nagging injury and get me back to training for my next marathon.  Working with Dr. Rachel is much more than being prescribed exercises and following up on progress.  Her knowledge of working with runners and the mentality that is common amongst us was a key in my success.  Towards the end of the program, I realized the coaching, encouragement and rebuilding of confidence in myself was probably even more important than the original injury that led me to seek her help.  I greatly appreciate her thoughtfulness and specific treatments for my ankle that I would never have gotten from my own research or working with someone that doesn't get us runners.

RW Physical Therapy and Performance,(973) 865-6059,ChIJ0SnjLzbHwogRhF6sSENt890,Tylor Streett,5,"Rachel was absolutely wonderful! I came to her after spending the last few years developing greater and greater pain in my ankle and foot after surgeries in 2018/2019. I had gone the classic route with traditional box PT to get me back to running and rock climbing, but I never reached my old abilities. I began working with Rachel this summer in preparation for a backyard ultra with the goal of increasing my my ROM and reducing pain and swelling in my ankle for long distance races. I was competing in a summer short course series and ended the season with 3 individual race podiums and an overall series podium. At my looped ultra, I unfortunately did not achieve my distance goals, thanks mostly to a major storm, but I WAS able to walk away with minimal pain and swelling where just a few months earlier I was hobbled for more than a week recovering from a shorter distance. This was a HUGE VICTORY!! Movement for recovery after these ultra distances is crucial, and being practically immobile, as if I had just broken my ankle again after every big event, was not sustainable. I'm so glad I took a chance with Dr. Waugh and I am more excited about my next ultra this fall knowing I have the tools and the recovery I have been looking for these last 5+ years.

We have a four pound tea cup Yorkie who went through Yelena's training program. At first we were a little nervous because he was so small, it was an investment, and it was for a month. We compared this program with many other ""shorter"" and ""less expensive ones"" and the benefits of her training program outweighed the others by miles. It was also clear from the beginning that Yelena loves what she does and this is MORE than a job to her. Now, one year later after our dog has finished the training program, I can tell you that we find ourselves saying out loud every day that we are so thankful we sent our dog to her training program. Yes - it is an initial ""investment"" - but the fact that we know that our dog will be so well trained for LIFE makes our investment worth every single penny. We have a lot of friends with dogs and our dog is the MOST well behaved by light years - and when we do group walks he listens to us with no problem (OFF LEASH) when all of our  friends are struggling with their dogs and we know that stems from Yelena.

The barn may neglect your horse, withholding food and exposing it to the elements, leading to significant weight loss. They may also damage your tack by leaving it outdoors. Despite needing assistance to sell or rehome my horse, there was no help provided, and my horse lost 200 pounds over three months. This lack of professionalism and compassion from Dot Suto Graves the trainer at Razorback Equestrian Center LLC, who I believe should be reported for neglect, is unacceptable.

No reputable barn would handle financial delinquencies in this manner. Typically, the protocol would be to sell the horse at auction and legally pursue the owner for any outstanding debt rather than resorting to neglect. Unfortunately, unpredictable events can complicate financial commitments.

When asked about the pricing the younger blonde girl got very ""valley girl/woke"" acting. She is NOT suited for the front desk. I stated such and was leaving. The manager (i assume. She never introduced herself) got off a call and asked the others to leave the desk. She and I spoke and she agreed the other staff didnt handle things or speak properly.

I tried the compression boots and red light therapy, and both were amazing. The compression felt great on my legs, especially after a long day, and the red light session was surprisingly relaxing.

From the very first session with Jose De La Cruz, I felt deeply supported, safe, and guided toward uncovering subconscious patterns that had been holding me back.

What truly set this experience apart was the way hypnotherapy seamlessly integrated with my existing wellness practices. It allowed me to bypass the conscious mind’s resistance and tap into a deep well of inner wisdom, facilitating breakthroughs that traditional methods never quite reached. I released emotional weight I had carried for years, rewired limiting beliefs, and emerged with a sense of clarity, confidence, and peace that felt completely organic and lasting.

The results were nothing short of immeasurable. Not only did I notice shifts in my mindset and emotional well-being, but my physical body responded as well—better sleep, reduced stress, and an overall sense of balance. I now recommend hypnotherapy to my clients as a powerful complement to their healing journeys.

Brian built on that by designing an advanced shoulder workout for me. He also explained the difference between “good pain” and “bad pain” which was a major turning point for me. I had been too cautious out of fear of re-injury but he helped me push through in the right way.

Erika is also extremely skilled. She’s an expert in dry needling and explains everything very clearly. She took the time to help me understand what was happening at an anatomical level and also how to maintain and build on the improvement I’ve made so far.

I’m very grateful to this team and can’t recommend them highly enough.",2025-05-31 12:42:12,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJuOPSbryKMciLN_F4cmUyN--RgdrVgYIFhnMiHwzsbn0fJ6Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:17:49.949437,,

He’s also, more generally well-rounded. His recall is super reliable, and he seems happier and more confident overall. I’ve continued boarding him with them when I travel because I know he’s in good hands and actually enjoys being there.

Neptune, my now year and half old Great Dane, and I have worked with all of them and found them all to be absolute professionals who were able to educate the both of us to be better. Luke has been our constant, Neptune did his initial 10 day B&T with Luke. During his time with Luke he became a changed dog, the e-collar training was a game changer for me. When Neptune had some regression (the joys of an adolescent dog) Luke spent time during a Board and Tune to bring Neptune back up to speed on proper behaviors. The continued support of Pack Walks and Board & Tunes have been game changers for us.

Owners, please know that these trainings are just the beginning if you have a bull-headed dog like mine, we spend 2 hrs a day to continue building and reinforcing proper behaviors.

The first 3 months he was recovering from influenza. As he became healthier, he began displaying unhealthy behaviors. Demand barking, separation anxiety, and he had no clue what commands were.
I began looking for dog trainers that would work with him, of 7 companies only 2 said yes, of those 2 I selected Revolution. Erica is a GODESS! Seriously, we had my deaf and toothless elderly doggo learning! She even identified potential trauma responses and helped me navigate through those issues. In fact on the last training day, I was particularly stressed and she smoothly got us through some particularly difficult behavior hurdles!
So the thing I loved most is that her advice is customized to the needs of the dog and she teaches the humans to integrate the behaviors that correct the dogs and really truly helping humans be autonomous. If you are willing to put the work in, you will SEE results! There are massive changed in my Winston after in home training with Erica! She trained with me, took him to restaurants, we worked at different places, with different dogs, and different times of day!
Revolution and Erica are spectacular... we love her working dogs Aria and Poison Ivy!! Truly if you have that fur baby that is just difficult to train... or has disabilities like my Winston...

Revolution Dog Training,(813) 777-0681,ChIJxSVa21HqwogRShYh5GxA3ag,Sheridan Boyle,5,"We adopted a five-month-old mixed breed puppy (Conga) with a ton of energy. We always wanted to work with a trainer for general puppy obedience, but we quickly realized that we needed more help. She was tearing up our house and, more seriously, starting to act overly dominant and territorial towards our small senior dog. It got to the point where we could not have them in the same room together and she would even charge the baby gate that we had separating them. I didn't know if we were going to be able to keep her.

After a wonderful consultation with Erica, we decided to do a 7-day board and train with Luke and then follow up with 1:1 sessions. Luke was awesome to work with. He took Conga everywhere and she came back much improved - she was crate trained (she used to scream for 30 minutes if we put her in the crate, now she voluntarily goes in). She no longer chewed up our couch, or our base boards, or other furniture. She went from peeing and pooping in the house several times a day to only having one accident in the two weeks she has been back. And she is a dream to walk on the leash now.

After a day of having her back, Conga started to target our small senior dog again. We did one session in our home with Erica and it made a HUGE difference. That very day, they fell asleep on the couch together. Now we can have them loose in the same room together, in the back yard together, and they do love going on walks together. In fact, they are both sleeping next to me as I write this.

It's my responsibility to keep these good behaviors going and I feel confident in the knowledge that both Luke and Erica gave me. Conga just needed structure and to be shown that I set the boundaries and we can all still have fun that way.

He is one of the most dedicated and profound individuals I've ever met. In this contemporary world where everybody is always in a rush, Bill really takes his time and focuses on you, your pain... and believe me, he can really listen to it, don't ask me how. He has magic hands, and so much wisdom and experience in them; they are full of patience, and is amazing how they can interpret what your muscles express without you even knowing about it, or understanding about it. He really works on some other level of knowledge, and even language, in regards to the neuromuscular field. I have no words to describe what is receiving a therapy from him. It's like nothing I've experienced before; there is so much beauty and respect in being so specific and detail-oriented. When I open that door, is the moment of healing, peace and communication with oneself. Entering into his space, is giving yourself a second chance. I'm extremely thankful for what he has done for me and my muscle pain. I'm in this journey of recovery one step at a time, and I feel so lucky to have him helping me out with perseverance, education and care. I really believe he goes beyond the ""four walls"" of medicine, and he enters into this realm full of individuality, where each person is different; therefore, each treatment is about you and only you. In every session, he reads you like a book, and he is able to find where the root of the problem is. He is then able to release, ""squeezing out"" everything that is trapped in your points that cause the pain, and every place else that is affected by it. His techniques are mesmerizing. He also sees the complexity of the body as a whole, and you can really get surprised about how things that seem disconnected, are really linked at the end. Everything is related, and that is an unbelievable discovery in the path of getting better. He also expands your healing by advising you on how to modify everyday habits that will lead you to a better care of your body. Thank you Bill for your incredible talent, professionalism and all the time you take with each of the people you help; and overall, for making that time, so valuable, rich and important for me.

River Mill Animal Hospital - Dr. Tammie Hodge,(813) 501-4985,ChIJbZjdqzu0wogRXQB-7Vxebpc,Mike DeGagne,3,"Good veterinary care, but avoid purchasing prescriptions here

We’ve had positive experiences with the veterinary care itself. However, I strongly advise against buying your pet’s prescriptions through this office. We were previously ordering through Chewy when the clinic called us directly, promising better pricing if we switched to their service. Unfortunately, their outsourced pharmacy was delayed, and in the meantime, they charged us for a partial supply of pills at a much higher per-pill rate when we picked them up at the clinic. The price for these pills was several times higher than what we usually pay.

When I inquired about the price difference, the delay, and why we were charged so much more for a reduced quantity, the staff simply stated that they charge different rates for pills picked up at the clinic versus those ordered through their pharmacy partner. There was no effort to address or resolve the issue.

Bottom line: while I don’t believe they intentionally misled us, they showed little concern for our situation and took no responsibility for the inconvenience. I recommend getting prescriptions elsewhere.

This was a 1 star customer experience but our other experiences were generally positive.",2025-07-01 16:41:19,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWHiYAxVk0HjufpLjQzua4-7q4CtrN4nPmNLU1GDV6nRqesmp4N=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:17:59.113099,,

At first, his gentle approach had me worried it might turn into one of those light, generic Swedish massages—but once I asked for firmer pressure, he absolutely delivered. You can instantly tell the difference between a masseuse going through a template of strokes and one who truly understands the body.

I have scoliosis, which makes each side of my back completely different, and Raul immediately recognized the imbalances without me even needing to explain. He customized every technique and stroke to match what my body actually needed. He found and released tight spots I haven’t been able to get to with stretches or massage tools—especially around the pec area.

That area can feel a little anxiety-inducing as a woman when a male therapist works on it, but Raul was respectful and professional. His focus was entirely on the work, and thanks to him, those stubborn knots are finally gone.

"Robin Best, CCC PA Speech Language Pathologist",(954) 629-1521,ChIJu8Cwm8Ea2YgRGIHr77-vlhc,ERICA REILLY,5,"We’ve had the absolute pleasure of working with Robin Best, a truly exceptional speech pathologist, for the past four months, and I cannot express enough how grateful we are for her. She has been working with our almost 3-year-old son, and the growth we’ve seen in such a short time is nothing short of amazing.

Robin is elite at what she does—her passion for helping children communicate more confidently shines through in every session. She brings not only deep knowledge and expertise, but also an incredible warmth and energy that immediately puts both parents and children at ease.

Every week, she provides us with thoughtful, detailed progress updates and helpful tips for what we can do at home to support our son’s progress. Her communication is top-notch—she makes us feel like true partners in the process, and that means the world to us.

What sets Robin apart is that she’s not just doing a job—she’s fulfilling a calling. Her heart is fully in this work, and it shows. We truly believe she is a gift, and we feel so lucky to have her as part of our son’s early development journey.

If you are looking for someone who is knowledgeable, passionate, dedicated, and genuinely invested in your child’s success, Robin Best is the one. We can’t recommend her enough!!",2025-04-01 18:42:10,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLBJppLMOjHF1_gPpcZiK-8Y_7wPqZHm54aGKpqBoEB6ojRTQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:18:02.320256,,

We were recommended to her by a family friend who insisted she is the only one who could get her son to talk.

She is a rare gem who does the job because she loves it and she genuinely cares about her clients and their progress.  She goes out of her way to connect with our son and constantly is buying and trying new things to keep him engaged and try to get him to speak.

She is also always willing to discuss anything you are concerned about and gets so excited at all of his progress, in and outside of her sessions.  She has worked with our son's difficult schedule and while she is always beyond professional, she really feels more like a member of our family with a very personal interest in our son's success.

Robin's K9 Lifestyle,(352) 580-6503,ChIJL3lPFNwd5ogRcO8P3jIDxLY,Mia Kawaida,5,"Still remember the day I talked to Robin on a phone for the first time to discuss my dogs’ issues on leash and if she’s the right fit. Nowadays, I feel it’s very hard to find someone who’s not pushy and doesn’t throw sales pitch at you because at the end of the day all they care is $$$. I instantly knew Robin isn’t one of those and she truly cares about providing what my dogs need. We took her lesson once a month for three months. I continued to do what she taught us during the lesson between each lesson. Also, she was always available via texts- I sent her videos of us doing the training at home, and she gave me feedback, which was extremely helpful! In a matter of 3 months, I feel like I have two different dogs on leash. She recognized and understood differences in personalities and issues between two of my dogs, so she utilized different approaches (again she really provides your dog with what THEY need!!!) Walking used to be not enjoyable due to their poor behavior, but now I take my dogs on a walk twice a day, and each walk reminds me of the impact Robin’s training has made on all three of us, not just the dogs.

We ended up having to board our pup here for a very last-minute trip. We are sort of helicopter parents and were very worried, and thus very selective, about sending her someplace, particularly as she is quite sensitive and needy.

Rocky's got back to me very quickly regarding my inquiry and I was able to tour the facility the very same day! I was very relieved to see the quality of their boarding facilities (i.e. how many different rooms you can choose from, the separation of groups of dogs so they're not all overstimulated in a single room, how SECURE the facility itself and the accommodations for the dogs are) as well as the great outdoor space.
The backyard area is huge and with PLENTY of shade (very important for Florida lol)! So many different areas as well to accommodate your dogs' needs, for example, if they need to be alone and/or with a smaller group of dogs.

Along with that, Rocky's provides a THOROUGH form to fill out so they can get to know every little thing about your pup! Again, it made me feel so much better to know that they will and do pay attention to each individual dog's needs and personality.

On top of that, every staff member I interacted with was so lovely. Bailey gave us the tour and started us off with the process and her kind energy set the tone. I communicated with Angela regularly leading up to and throughout our pup's time at Rocky's and she was just as lovely! The photos and videos Rocky's provide you for each dog's ""post card"" only further reinforce my trust in all the staff here.

Really, I am truly super protective of my pup. She is my whole world, I fret over her no matter what! But Rocky's 100% put me at ease the whole time.

I just sneezed and felt no pain in my back!

Although I was slightly scared of how painful Rolfing would be, Yvette was great at making my fear dissipate right away. The moment she started to work on my body, it was constant relief that gave me chills multiple times. I started to feel spacious, not just in the section she was working on, but throughout the body.

I felt relief in my back as she moved the fascia around my legs and feet, and especially appreciated the work she did to get my pelvic floor back into alignment. I had never experienced that kind of relief of pressure before.

Yvette was super professional, fun to be around, and very informative about the unconscious habits that I should look out for and modify.

Rose Lesniak Dog Trainer,(305) 868-8109,ChIJJfcRR9mz2YgRLN9JlS9Juao,Aifa Alvarez,5,"When we first decided to get a dog we had no idea what breed to choose. The idea was to get a service dog for my husband to help with his mobility and mental wellbeing. At the time, we lived in a small condo apartment. Rose helped us choose the best breed for the job.
When we got Kona (Staffordshire bull terrier) he was nine weeks old and full of energy. Right there and then the training road began. Kona was a puppy trying to eat everything at home, jumping on furniture,  not listening to any command whatsoever, jumping on people, nipping people, pulling on the leash, approaching every single person or dog he saw. He is now a well-behaved service dog. He is now capable of bracing to help my husband get up from a sitting position, of pulling him when he needs assistance walking, of doing deep chest compressions when anxiety hits. I am not even going to mention that he listens when you give him a command. He walks close to us without pulling. He goes into restaurants and quietly waits for us to eat lying down under the table. What can I say, what progress!
When you hire Rose you better get ready for training. There is no such a thing as a training lesson without the owner. There is no sugar coating. She goes straight to the point and trains hard. You will be trained and then you will train your dog. She will advise you on best diet choices for your dog, and on the best training techniques you could find. Rose is a positive reinforcement trainer, rewards based.  You will need a lot of patience but it will definitively pay off. Your dog will learn; it is a fact. You will learn too; it is a fact.

I contacted her after reading the positive reviews she had and I was greatly pleased with her work. First of all she is very reliable in terms of schedules. She always sends a confirmation message the day before the appointment and she always arrived on time. But the best part is the amazing technique she has for dog training. We took 3 lessons where our Simba (a 1.5 very energetic puppy) improved a lot. Her technique puts the respect for the dog at the center of everything and it’s really about teaching the owners how to understand and reward positive behaviors on dogs. We notice great differences right after the 1st session and by the end of the third, Simba was super responsive on all “inside the house” commands and also on leash walking. She also gave us great recommendations on the type of treats to use to reward him, the best leash for teaching, etc.

Our frenchies, Anna and Charlie, have been going to her day school, boarded and trained with her, and done at home lessons (to include our more mature dog Cesar as well). They always run to the car all excited thinking they’re going to school!!

Ever since we started working with Sofia, we’ve seen a tremendous positive change in our pups. Anna absolutely adored all the training with Sofia and truly became a well behaved, yet still wild in the best way, puppy because of her guidance and the effort Sofia put into training her. She mastered all the basic commands in no time and Sofia helped lay the foundation for fun trick training we could practice with her in the future.

Charlie, being deaf and with an unknown past, has  always been a challenge to us, but he has been making great progress with Sofia as well, and we feel confident that even though he requires a little bit of extra effort, he will get to where he needs to be thanks to Ruff Times.

Shibas are notoriously hard to train, but Sofia worked with Susan and put a lot of time and effort into making sure she was getting through! Additionally, she sent thorough explanations of dog psychology, how to use the commands, and how to best work with Susan going forward.

My favorite part was that through her videos and messages, we could tell that Sofia really cared for our baby and she was getting the love that we couldn’t give her while we were away.

We’re happy to have Susan home and she is definitely still our playful puppy, but has been much better behaved since her stay at Ruff Times!

It’s so great to know that we can trust Ruff Times for boarding when we travel, and for support with training for Susan when we need it!",2025-06-01 14:09:57,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWtPnk7n_3CerGGs68RDxAMmsj1qIpBRnsdBohpIQ-rerBPC7SV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:18:08.529680,,

She worked with my two German Shepherds while I was on vacation, and even though they were only with her for a short time, the results have been amazing.

Before training, I honestly believed my dogs just couldn’t be around other dogs without issues—but Sofia completely changed that. She worked wonders with them! They are now so much more patient, especially on walks and when they’re near other dogs. I’ve even started taking them to the dog park, something I never thought I’d be able to do without stress or worry.

Sofia clearly has a gift with animals and treated my dogs with the same love and care I would. I'm so grateful for the work she put in—she truly gave me peace of mind and gave my dogs the confidence and structure they needed.

He is the best. He takes his time with his patients to really listen to their concerns and worries. He will spend as much time as he needs with a patient to put the concerns to rest. I was terrified after my wreak that my back and neck would be in constant pain forever and that I wouldn't feel any better. Dr. Ruggiero put those fears to rest explaining with the proper exercises and care that I would nearly pain free and only feel a few aches and pains occasionally or if I didn't take proper care of it.

Russell's K9 Academy,(386) 320-1896,ChIJR4FYgXTZ5ogR6oa-wyMJRwE,Brian S,5,"Earlier this year we took a chance using Russell's K9 after finding a dog that was tied to a tree and left behind the year prior. Her name is Sunny, and unfortunately seems to have a background/history that was not in her favor which resulted in multiple behavior issues including agression towards men and control. We are glad we took that chance. Mr. Russell cares about these dogs at a deep level, and is up front and realistic. If you are looking for an easy fix, and not willing to work with your animal this is not the trainer for you and he will be direct and upfront about that. We took a dog that was nearly uncontrolable on a leash walking by people, to now walking our streets with no leash, and in full control with confidence. Saving her life was a mission of ours after finding her, and Russell's program has been a huge part of her progress. This is not a shock collar program, this training teaches your dog a solid foundation to respond to verbal commands / markers before even thinking about using the e collar. The e collar is a tool in the tool box rather than the only means of control, which is what we wanted instead of just punishment by collar.

She became extremely reactive and began resource protecting - although she is an utter sweetheart, she would bark aggressively at other dogs, children, bicycles - to the point we could no longer walk her in our neighborhood or drive with her in the car.  We were at our wit's end.  We tried one training center for a few months but because she was only there during the day, she was an angel with the trainers but would go back to her old tricks at home, and we were not receiving the proper training ourselves to make any training effective.  Thankfully we found Russell's K9.  She boarded with Al for 9 weeks - it was extremely hard to part with her for that amount of time, and to be consistent in our behavior when we visited for our training with her, after she'd been there a few weeks.  But I'm so grateful we stuck with it.  She's been home a few days and is definitely testing her limits - but we now know how to handle her so that she feels safe and does not react to external forces.  We can calmly walk her through our neighborhood, and with a simple ""Nope"" she restrains herself from her old behaviors.

He is the only chiropractor I know personally who has advanced degrees and post-graduate training in functional neurology and sports medicine, applying his knowledge and techniques across a wide variety of cases. What I like most about working with Dr. Russo is that he is a very friendly and approachable ""straight-up"" kind of guy, who will always give you an honest assessment of your condition and what he can do for you, even if that means referring you to another practitioner who he believes is better suited to treat your particular problem. His initial assessment is very thorough and usually includes x-rays or other medical tests that he needs in order to provide you with the best treatment plan for achieving the most optimal outcome. In my experience, Dr. Russo cares deeply about his patients and will take whatever measures are necessary to help his patients in attaining the highest level of medical improvement within that patient's physical limitations. I have been working with him recently after shattering my left kneecap. I wasn't improving until I began physical therapy with him. He designed an individualized program for me that, in 8 weeks, had my knee bending much further than it could on my first visit.

SPEAK EASY SOLUTIONS,(407) 359-5693,ChIJ_____0N754gRAtLVsH4s24k,Jessica Godette,1,"I cannot speak for the therapists, but as for the front desk staff and office manager, they have been extremely unorganized and unhelpful. My child’s doctor’s office faxed all the requested documentation in February 2025. They followed up with another fax in March 2025 to confirm whether my child had received services and to ask if anything additional was needed. They received no response.

In September 2025, I contacted the office to confirm my child’s status on the waitlist. I was informed by both Kaitlyn and Ayana that the required documents were “never received,” and therefore my child was never added to the waitlist. However, I was later told that while the referral was received, the diagnostic report was not. If that was the case, why did the office never reach out or respond to the March fax requesting clarification?

I reconfirmed with my child’s doctor’s office, and they verified that both the referral and the diagnostic report were faxed in February 2025.
When I addressed this with Ayana, her response was simply, “I’m so sorry, we never got it.” She also stated that the office manager is the only person with access to the faxes. This makes it even more concerning that no follow-up ever occurred.

As a result of this oversight, my son has now lost seven months waiting for services on what is already a year-long waitlist—only to find out he was never placed on it at all.

Due to these reasons, I have decided not to continue with this provider and will be seeking services elsewhere.",2025-09-06 10:40:48,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJfk2WckwEknNEJmArsiaVlhFLNSludb9WlXrc4Vi0-qih-S2VR=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:18:17.244657,,
SPEAK EASY SOLUTIONS,(407) 359-5693,ChIJ_____0N754gRAtLVsH4s24k,Gabriella D,1,"Don't go here. Save your money, time & effort. This business shouldn't be allowed to operate.
I brought my toddler here due to him having severe feeding difficulties; he was refusing most solids. Speak Easy's website misleadingly says it has a feeding therapy program, but it is really not feeding therapy at all. Megan is no help with feeding and cares only about profit rather than helping your child progress. With my son being behind physically as well, she suggested ""co-treating"" him in a half hour session for both physical & feeding therapy. That sounds great in theory, but the reality is that she wanted to be able to bill us for both in one half hour session rather than two separate sessions. ""Co-treating"" consisted of myself, son, her and the physical therapist sitting around BS-ing, and with her saying, ""We're not going to get to the food today"" for no apparent reason. After several sessions of doing absolutely nothing with food (and really nothing in general besides sitting around talking), when I voiced my desire to split sessions into separate physical and feeding therapy, she tried to argue that that would be ""too much"" for my son. She also told me I need to bring my own high chair. What kind of feeding therapy makes you bring your own high chair? That is not possible considering I come to appointments alone carrying my son (who was not yet walking at the time) and two bags already.
I also found out after I stopped wasting my time going that I was taken before others who had been on a waitlist for longer due to the fact that my insurance paid her practice more than the insurances of the others who were still waiting.
The hardest thing about addressing your child's delays and doing what's best for them is navigating through BS practices like this place and therapists/owners like Megan who profit off of wasting your time and not actually furthering your child's development. Do yourself and your child a favor and take your business elsewhere, especially if feeding therapy is needed, as this place should not be allowed to say that they offer that.",2025-05-22 14:03:41,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocItriohX2Db7891SMAGiPhQCB_TTwQYKuT_LqYYDzxu7D3ngg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:18:17.244657,,

I requested in person, by phone, and via email the report of findings of such. I was told  the therapist had up to seven days to complete the medical note. As of today I have not received the medical note, the findings, recommendations. No follow up contact has been provided.

Per therapist, the initial evaluation was only for medical insurance purpose. She offered no feedback, did not address  my questions or her findings. When I asked how often she will recommend therapies she replied by simply asking me what type of medical insurance we had. In other words recommendations and diagnosis  will depend on the insurance policy?! I am very dissatisfied with the lack of professionalism and level of care offered by this place. All they seem to care is about billing insurance and generating numbers.

Sage Wellness - 8th Ave,(352) 474-8882,ChIJuWZ_RVW96IgRBhYk8cWlOYo,Tobias Pardue,5,"First, I discovered the many benefits of talk therapy in my early 30s.  I have been blessed with great therapists, thus great results.   After suffering two moderate-severe TBIs in 14 months, and losing my ability to speak, my courtroom days were done…or so I thought.

After four plus years of slow but steady progress in adapting to my new reality, I wanted to find a great PhD therapist in our area.  A family member found Sage, called the office, explained everything, and asked which therapist would be the best fit.   Dr. Nick Comeau was the recommendation.  I was even allowed to have a ten minute conversation on the phone with Dr. Nick, before scheduling my first session, just to make sure we were a good fit.  This is an important difference between Sage and others, and really helps to establish the best possible relationship.

He has been more active and responsive than anyone I’ve seen before.  All I can honestly say is that he cares about his patients, he cares about our wellbeing and wants nothing more than to see us succeed.  At Sage, honesty, openness, and empathy are the norm, which is refreshing considering the way the world seems to be changing.

I’m a 54yo, retired/disabled attorney who benefits immensely from working with Dr. Comeau.  I would highly recommend Sage to anyone who genuinely wants to help themselves…they will facilitate your journey.

Meyer also became a first place confirmation winner but his claim to fame was being a weekly therapy dog at Shriners Children’s hospital for 11 years.  Sadly all three are gone now; Travis, Meyer & Shriners.  But the third puppy Brenda trained was Spencer & his role in my life now is my constant companion & best Buddy ever!

From the very first meeting, Eric showed compassion, professionalism, and a genuine understanding of our situation. Finding the right assisted living option for our loved one was overwhelming, but Eric made the process not only manageable but comforting. He took the time to listen to our concerns, answered every question (no matter how small), and never once made us feel rushed or pressured.

What truly stood out was how personally invested Eric was in making sure our loved one would feel safe, respected, and at home. He coordinated tours, helped us navigate the paperwork, and stayed in constant communication. It didn’t feel like working with a salesperson; it felt like working with a trusted advisor and advocate.

Thanks to Eric, we found a community for our mother and our entire family has peace of mind. It’s rare to encounter someone who combines heart, knowledge, and professionalism so seamlessly. We are forever grateful.

Now, my knee is back to 100% for the first time since my injury- which I didn’t think was possible- and my shoulder is remarkably better. Samson gave me the tools to get to this point and the best part is that I get to take those tools and use them going forward on my own.

Santiso Physical Therapy Fort Lauderdale,(954) 533-5543,ChIJdQEWBfoB2YgRS-kzYqVhQwI,Jeff Birch,5,"I cannot recommend Aaron Santizo and his team at Santiso Physical Therapy highly enough. Aaron is soft-spoken, highly skilled, and clearly very experienced in his field. I was referred to Santizo Physical Therapy by my family doctor after an MRI confirmed I had a torn meniscus. Through consultations and further research, I concluded that surgery wouldn’t truly resolve my issue, so I sought alternative treatment.

From my first visit, Aaron quickly assessed my situation with precision. He performed a minor acupuncture-like procedure and then entrusted my care to one of his team members. This young professional was incredibly knowledgeable, well-trained, and handled my treatment with utmost professionalism.

Although I haven’t been as consistent with their prescribed regimen due to living abroad, I am deeply impressed by the organization and their approach. I’m even considering flying in weekly just to continue this process, as I firmly believe they can significantly improve my condition without surgery. At 68, that means everything to me.

Sarkis Family Psychiatry,(352) 331-5100,ChIJSyRA56O86IgRQNIJWraMhKA,Rachel Howick,1,"I would not recommend this practice or Megan Cutter specifically. Stay away! I saw Megan Cutter at Sarkis from approximately 2017 - 2025. I was an excellent patient for almost a decade and had an amazing relationship with Megan throughout my treatment at Sarkis. I never had any issues with billing or any of the staff. I last saw Megan about a month ago. During that time she did not once mention that I had a past due balance at her office. Today I called my pharmacy to find that she never called in my prescriptions after the last visit. I called her office to settle my account and was treated so poorly by the office staff. I was also told that Megan was aware of the situation and had directed this person and her actions. I immediately paid my bill, had them call in the medications that they were supposed to and told them to cancel my future appointments with their office. I was offered no apologies, so kindness, nothing. After a decade-long relationship. I am hurt personally and I am appalled at the unprofessional behavior of Megan Cutter and Sarkis Family Psychiatry. You are working with people who have severe anxiety and other mental health problems. Be kind.

Sarkis Family Psychiatry,(352) 331-5100,ChIJSyRA56O86IgRQNIJWraMhKA,Declan Phillips,5,"This was the best experience I ever had with doctors. I was skeptical because when I called to make the appointment they guided me to a nurse practitioner, as opposed to a doctor. I was also worried because it is a private pay only facility that they were going to take my money and not help me (as has happened so many times in the past). Once I got there I just felt like they actually cared, the front desk staff immediately asked me who I was and what time my appointment was, and when they looked in the file they had from filling out the initial appointment review they immediately gave me the packet I needed to fill out (only a few pages) then as soon as I sat down to fill it out Ashley called me (by the correct pronunciation of my name) to get my vitals and weight. After that I returned to the nice waiting area, which had a place for children to play, and finished filling out my 3 page of form.

My appointment was at 2:15, I got there at 1:45, and after I had finished everything the nurse practitioner called me in. This is where I thought I was going to be evaluated for 10 minutes and sent on my way with the same meds I’ve always taken...

Heather spent close to an hour and a half with me... talking about everything going on in my life, getting to know me, and evaluating me as every doctor should do with a new patient. She was the kindest sweetest doctor, and I really felt like she actually cared about me. At the end she did continue me on the medication I regularly take, but she also went out of her way to put me on a new medicine to help with some other issues I’ve been dealing with. She was the best.

Let me reiterate, Heather was the best mental health professional I’ve ever spoken to.

They didn’t ask for money until after I finished my hour and a half evaluation, and only after they prescribed me my normal medication and a new medication to help with my current issues. So for anyone worried about wasting money on them, please don’t be scared. This is a real doctors office with professionals at every level from the front desk to the doctors that evaluate you.

I can’t sing the praises of Ms. Heather enough. What a wonderful woman that actually cares. I was literally blown away by how amazing this doctor was. I can’t thank her enough for how good of an experience I had.

I honestly look forward to my next appointment.",2018-09-26 17:13:08,7 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-wM-TQymlxIKPNlCdaVHxZ7sFyuJP3KnDumILX1t7H-eBXhDe=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:18:31.464176,,
Sarkis Family Psychiatry,(352) 331-5100,ChIJSyRA56O86IgRQNIJWraMhKA,Kameron Griffis,2,"Bad experience here. Tried 2 different doctors and had the same situations occur. Major lack of transparency in the patient/doctor relationship. First of all, I was never told what my diagnosis was. I had to drag it out of my doctor 6 months into treatment. Secondly, I was prescribed medicine without being told what it was for. Later I found out they gave me an off label prescription for a medicine that had no connection to my diagnosis. After 7 months of being on one certain medicine (with absolutely no effect) the doctor just increased the dosage and prescribed more medicine on top of it instead of admitting that the medication wasn’t right for me. Both doctors were condescending and treated me as if I was a kid. Definitely not what I’m looking for in a doctor. Front staff are really nice, so I’m giving the review an extra star.

I came to this facility after been in few places. My total recuperation involved almost a year of therapy. It must sound ridiculous, but I can say I have some experience! I can assure you this is a top of the line place; the difference is the human quality that you find here.
Firstly, you feel that you are not a number but rather an individual in need of support and help with physical injuries - discomfort-pain and so on.
Everyone in this facility makes you feel that you are not alone dealing with challenges. There's always a sense of happiness, nice music, some laughs, and compassion.  From the moment you arrive at the front office, Oscar will greet you with a big smile. You feel welcome. Excellent customer service. You can feel safe here; there is constant cleaning and disinfecting before and after using any equipment.

In a time when some healthcare workers may seem indifferent, it is so refreshing to find a place where you feel truly heard and cared for. From the moment I walked in, I felt safe and supported. I came in scared and overwhelmed, dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic brain injury and a recent hit to the head. On top of that, persistent post-concussion syndrome, cervical instability, and bulging discs made every day feel like a struggle.

I cannot thank Select Physical Therapy enough for treating me like a human being, not just another patient . The staff takes the time to understand where you're at emotionally and physically, and they work with you to build your strength and recovery, step by step. They understand there are good days and bad days, and they adapt accordingly, always pushing you just the right amount. I have been making steady progress, and while it hasn’t always been easy, I’m so grateful to have them by my side. What sets Select apart is that they don’t rush you.

I am amazed by the speed of my recovery, which is ahead of my schedule, due to the dedication and professionalism of the Team.
First you receive a call the day before the appt to remind you and is very helpful.
Their staff is well prepared, they speak English and Spanish.
Also I noticed a bday experience since they have worked with professional athletes.

They monitor your progress with computers on every session, they used very advanced therapy equipment.
I haven't had any pain during the treatment. It has been a true pleasure getting my therapy here.

Select Physical Therapy - Coral Springs - The Walk,(954) 227-8040,ChIJ6Y9MPTcF2YgRbpna-eP2p5o,Nicole A,5,"After suffering from a serious fall down 14 concrete steps, life has been difficult. I became immobile, lost muscle, and gained weight. I went from a fast walker to excruciating pain, simply trying to get my legs off of my bed! My orthopedic doctor, Dr. Nathaniel Thomas wrote me a script for PT and highly recommended Select Physical Therapy! Oh my God, was he RIGHT!! From Soy at the front who greets everyone with a huge smile and great energy to Joy, who helped schedule my first appointment, and Kiara, who sadly works at the other location but was helping at Coral Springs, the staff is wonderful!
I didn't know what to expect with my first appointment as I've never been in PT before, and currently, it's to focus on my right knee that suffered severe damage from the fall. I was called back by Eric, who is truly one genuinely wonderful human!! Not only did he assure me that we would get me back on track, but he also implemented breathing techniques when I got overstimulated! I suffer from quite a few mental health issues, and it's rare that I find  people in the medical field who seem sensitive to neurodivergent patients.
I truly look forward to physical therapy, especially with Eric. He's quite popular, so booking him ahead of time is essential. However, everyone I've met thus far has been empathetic, knowledgeable, and professional.
My therapist, when she needed PT, went here as well! 😅 That's how great they are!!

She reached out to her primary doctor, who confirmed that the referral had been prepared and faxed to your facility. When I called to schedule the appointment, the receptionist was not only rude but also dismissive. She immediately asked for insurance and said that a referral was required. I explained that her primary doctor had assured us the referral was sent, yet her response was simply “well, it’s not here,” without even asking for any patient details.

I requested to speak with a manager, and after being put on hold for 32 minutes, the call was ended. I tried to call back, but there was no answer.

I scheduled an appointment for Monday (1/27) at 9AM. Upon arrival, the receptionist, Rosalina, informed me that I needed my prescription to be seen by a therapist. I responded that I wasn't aware I need this, but she claimed she called me the prior Friday and left me a VM explaining it was needed. I never received any message, and she proceeded to quote, with a sarcastic attitude, an incorrect phone number where she left this VM. She then told me my appointment was cancelled, so I responded by saying I would go elsewhere, and it seemed she could care less. I called yesterday afternoon to speak with the manager, and she told me she would send an email to make that happen. I called again today, and they are no longer answering my phone calls, so I left them a VM. No call from anyone in management yet, and I am assuming I won't get one at all. If you don't value your time, this is a good spot to go to. If you took time from work like I did, then stay away. There are plenty of other options for physical therapy.

Other facilities leave you for long periods of time without instructions on what to do next and basically are over booked so they barely interact with you.

Walking in I was greeted with a friendly smile from the receptionist an asked to fill out some paperwork for my visit.
After completing my paperwork, Christine greeted me with a pleasant smile and brought me back into the PT area. She took the time to ask me very pointed questions about my surgery and the pain I am experiencing. upon completing the question-and-answer interview, Christine spent the time to manually examine those areas that were giving me the most pain.
Christine had me do basic exercises to check my range of motion. After two sessions with Christine, I noticed remarkable improvement even my wife noticed the improvement. The improvement continues each and every time I have another PT session.
I cannot say enough positive things about the professionalism, caring, and concern for her patients she shows every day. I am so impressed with Christine that my wife who will be having knee surgery in the near future will be going to Select PT and requesting Christine.

Select Physical Therapy - Northdale,(813) 264-7734,ChIJXTE2Pp3AwogRzyLUVCwKo2s,Logan McIntyre,1,"I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE anyone from considering pursuing pelvic floor physical therapy at this location. I cannot speak to the quality of their other physical therapy services.

I came to this location a week ago for a  pelvic floor physical therapy intake. I was referred here by my doctor. I am very dissatisfied with my experience and have discontinued treatment here.

The pelvic floor physical therapist was visibly nervous, uncomfortable (especially during the diagnostic test), and perhaps even desperate. This of course made me feel nervous and uncomfortable. She spoke very fast and did not adequately explain her rationale for proposed treatments — worse still, the only exercise she proposed for me to do outside of session was outlined on a crude handout, and she did not provide instructions, walk me through it, or ensure that I was using proper technique (after discussing with another PT, it turns out, I was not doing it correctly at all). Additionally, the prescribed exercise contradicted the recommendations she provided during the session. (She said she did not want me to do any kegels, but kegels are a prominent part of the exercise in the handout.)

Overall, I felt that the therapist was reciting a slightly adapted script instead of engaging in a necessary dialogue about my symptoms and needs. She was eager to speak and give handouts but not to listen or adequately explain. I was not able to ask important questions because of how much she spoke. She was unprofessional regarding her criticism about my other medical providers.",2024-02-06 16:34:47,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXTDMPbHxjFVl4Ln5BMqdzntrUxOTh7leqgEFwaBsUFs6oHhOU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:18:51.452920,,

Select Physical Therapy - Royal Palm Beach,(561) 784-3767,ChIJjfDjFNsu2YgR8AHKZoj_NtI,mark rinaldi,1,"My daughter went there for physical therapy and was checking on her insurance.. but also asked what a direct price would be without insurance. They told us $100 directly or if we use insurance it would be 125 towards our deductible and an office visit(would have been around 200).. logically she decided she wanted to just pay $100 and not use the insurance. But the lady there said that once we know you have insurance, we cannot have you pay directly. That is just insane.
It’s obvious all they’re trying to do is they know they get more money for the insurance so they tell you, you can’t pay them directly.

I found myself suddenly needing physical therapy and I wasn’t sure of what to expect. What I can say is as soon as you walk into the lobby, it is extremely small but just wait a few minutes, that’s because the physical therapy room takes up 95% of the building and realistically, that is what we are there for.

So once you go into the PT room, there are multiple machines specialized to work on either your arms or your legs, stair steps, pulleys and work out balls to name a few things. Each section or each PT tech specializes in a different section of the body. So far I have witnessed physical therapy of the hands, arms and legs. I have seen people in casts, in wheelchairs and missing appendages. This team will find a way, no matter what, to get you back to where you need to be.

Special shoutout to the ladies in the front! They are your go-to if you need records or whatnot, so treat them right because they do so much for us. They are real angels too! And for the PT techs, Rhonda, hands down puts her heart and soul into what she does. She is stern but it’s only because she genuinely wants to see you succeed.

His therapist Mildred (Millie) was knowledgeable, professional, and thorough, explaining everything about his condition. Most sessions were with Tanya who was patient, kind, attentive, and worked with him at his pace — she truly made the difference, and he experienced noticeable relief after just a few sessions.
The front desk staff — especially Dionne and Linda — were welcoming, friendly, extremely knowledgeable and always tried to accommodate our schedule, making every visit easy and stress-free. We dealt with Joey just once, and she was great as well.

Select Physical Therapy - Tampa- Fowler Avenue,(813) 978-1704,ChIJ41uMvajHwogRR_qjU_m9cD4,Chris R,1,"Avoid Select Physical Therapy on Fowler – Absolute Nightmare!

If I could give zero stars, I would. The Select Physical Therapy location on Fowler Avenue is a joke. From the moment you walk in, you're hit with a nasty smell in the cramped and outdated waiting area. It’s like they haven’t cleaned in years. Definitely not a welcoming or professional environment.

The physical therapist I had was barely competent—seemed like they got their training off a YouTube crash course. The therapy was completely inadequate, and I left every session feeling like I wasted my time. On top of that, their technology is stuck in the Stone Age. Instead of using a proper digital system to provide exercises, they fumbled around, admitted they didn’t know how to use their own app, and just handed me a bunch of paper printouts. Seriously? In 2025?

Now let’s talk about the real disaster: the office manager, Reama. She will smile in your face to get you signed up, but once you're in, forget about decent customer service. She doesn’t keep her word, isn’t honest, and has the professionalism of a used car salesman. Once they have your money, you’re just another number.

Oh, and the equipment? Half of it looks like it was salvaged from a garage sale. Some of the machines are either outdated or barely functional. If you actually care about your recovery, do yourself a favor and go to the Select location on Himes instead. Doug runs a tight ship over there, and the difference is night and day.

Bottom line: If you want to be treated with respect and actually get proper therapy, STAY FAR AWAY from the ghetto fabulous disaster that is Select PT on Fowler.

If you are looking for someone who will genuinely care for you—not just physically, but emotionally and personally—Barbara is exactly who you need!!!!

Over the course of the nine months I spent in physical therapy, Barbara supported me in ways that went far beyond physical rehabilitation. Having undergone four knee surgeries in four years, I had lost confidence in my body’s ability to perform everyday tasks without pain or fear of re-injury. Barbara approached my recovery with remarkable patience, compassion, and encouragement. She consistently reaffirmed my progress and reminded me that I was putting in the necessary work to rebuild my strength.

On the difficult days, when the mental toll of yet another recovery felt overwhelming, Barbara was there—not just as a therapist, but as a steady source of emotional support. She listened without judgment, empathized with my frustrations, and helped me work through the psychological challenges of healing—something very few people truly understand.

Thanks to Barbara’s dedication and thoughtful care, I experienced a turning point in my recovery journey. For the first time in years, I am running without pain, anxiety, or fear. She never rushed my progress and always made me feel seen and supported.

I wholeheartedly recommend Barbara to anyone in need of physical therapy! Her impact on my life has been profound, and I am so grateful for the role she played in helping me heal. Thank you, sweet Barb Barb, for everything you did to help me get back on my feet—stronger and confident for the first time in four years!",2025-05-21 11:49:56,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWcWBYHVWoQdYtnNiTM4wK1EhXaDK_oyLIn5kQOLlATHEWeLgc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:19:04.607839,,

We tried to speak with the receptionist to explain that we do not speak English fluently and asked her to please be patient with us. Instead of showing understanding, she was extremely rude and disrespectful throughout the interaction.

When we later called to explain our situation more clearly and ask about rescheduling therapy sessions, she didn’t give us the chance to speak — she simply hung up on us. This is completely unacceptable behavior, especially in a healthcare setting where compassion and communication are essential.

We are requesting to speak with a manager as soon as possible to report this incident and to find a respectful and professional way to continue our therapy services.

Kim taught me how to integrate some daily things that I could do at home to help our son progress. She creates a plan tailored to the child's needs and implements it, modifying along the way as the child shows growth. She deeply cares for her patients and her staff. Kim is a very positive-minded person who stays informed with new approaches and therapeutic solutions including useful technological advances in the field of OT.

Sensory Pilates & Wellness - Davie,(954) 804-2865,ChIJfUnNbu6n2YgRPIiDuUv7Y_E,Ann Vacanti,5,"For years, I have had issues with my hip, which also led to back and knee pain. I’d seen three physical therapists, and two chiropractors, and all they succeeded in doing was taking my money.  As a result of this, I didn’t have very high expectations about Rehab Lab, but, after a week of constant back pain, I decided to give them a try. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made.
My therapist, Heidi, is fantastic!  She is so friendly and put me at ease right away. She listened to everything I said, and knew exactly what to do. She is extremely knowledgeable, patient, and doesn’t try to bully me or make me push myself before I’m ready.  Not only am I now practically pain free, I am actually improving my strength and fitness as a result of the work she does. I had never heard of dry-needling before this, and I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was willing to give it a try since nothing else had worked. It can certainly be uncomfortable, but the results are incredible!  My hip is vastly improved, as are my knee and back. In fact, once I saw the benefits of the needling, I asked Heidi to work on my traps, arms and shoulders - areas where I’d had issues in the past - and now those areas are better than they have been in years, no, decades!
I really didn’t think I would see or feel this much improvement, especially now that I’m in my mid-50’s.  I haven’t even had to take a single Aleve since I started this therapy, and I was taking them at least once a week. Quite simply, Heidi has changed my life.

Sensory Station Therapy,(561) 429-6018,ChIJ683SGB3V2IgRO3KTjcqOWd8,Kristen Karbowski,5,"We began our Occupational Therapy journey with Marisa at Sensory Station in May 2024. Marisa is a very compassionate, kind, patient, dedicated and knowledgeable Occupational Therapist and person. My daughter gravitated to Marisa and the Sensory Station setting fairly easy.
The sensory gym is a beautiful, clean, welcoming, child-friendly setting. Marisa provides services for children of all different abilities. In less than one year my daughter has gained a variety of stengths and skill sets that are providing her to grow, play and learn in a healthy, safe, effective and exciting manner.
Sensory integration requires a team effort for the process to be impactful and successful. Marisa has provided our family with knowledge, education and support to implement activities and exercises to carry over into our daughters daily routines at home and in the community.
I am a firm believer in the sensory integration theory. Marisa has over 27 years experience and I truly value her as a professional and confidant. Her heart is devoted to her career and her clients. We are so grateful for her. Our daughter makes progress everyday. We look forward to our sessions every week. We are forever thankful for Marisa and The Sensory Station. We are eager and excited to continue our sensory journey with Marisa and The Sensory Station which provides our daughter with the tools and enrichment to continue to grow, blossom and reach all her developmental milestones.",2025-04-17 23:21:06,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIrzvRARZbYaBgfVtm7n9xqT3VsQUvHj1ae6UHnEcsXzX9ncA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:19:10.966303,,
Sensory Station Therapy,(561) 429-6018,ChIJ683SGB3V2IgRO3KTjcqOWd8,Karlee Levinson,5,"We are so grateful to have found Sensory Station and Marisa. She has been an incredible support not only for our son, but for our entire family. Therapy with Marisa is never a one-size-fits-all approach, she truly sees each child as an individual and meets them exactly where they are.

When Hudson first started OT, he was struggling with coordination, regulation, and communication. Today, he’s a completely different kid — he’s jumping confidently, problem-solving through obstacle courses, and participating in activities like board games and art projects that once felt overwhelming to him. These improvements didn’t happen overnight, and I think it’s important for any parent considering OT to know that real progress takes time, trust, and the right connection. Marisa has built that connection with Hudson in a way that feels natural, encouraging, and empowering.

We can’t thank Marisa enough for their patience, creativity, and dedication. If you are looking for a place that truly understands sensory needs and how to nurture developmental growth, you’re in the best hands here.",2025-04-21 10:53:06,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKRL_AowAMijg4inJw3SDJw9u3EsxXokhnmtQtGoRqpnuGqMTU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:19:10.966303,,

Sensory Station Therapy,(561) 429-6018,ChIJ683SGB3V2IgRO3KTjcqOWd8,Sierra Cox,5,"Marisa at Sensory Station has truly been a miracle worker for my family. She started working with my son when he was just 6 months old. As my third child, I expected him to meet milestones quickly, but he wasn’t, and it left me feeling like I had failed him. I tried to help him catch up on my own but knew we needed extra support. A friend recommended Marisa, and from our very first conversation, we clicked. Her honesty and ability to make me feel included stood out. During such a scary time, she validated my feelings and gave me the confidence to move forward. Thanks to her, my son is now 19 months old, has caught up beautifully, and is even advanced in many areas.

Marisa has also transformed my relationship with my 6year old daughter.  My daughter and I were in a very tough place before we started OT in June. She’s always been incredibly strong-willed, but as she got older, her emotions and behaviors became overwhelming for both of us. I was in complete denial that anything was wrong, but deep down, I knew we needed help.

Before our evaluation, I sent Marisa a long text describing all the challenges we were facing. My daughter was constantly frustrated, throwing fits when she felt unheard, lashing out in anger, and struggling with consequences, fairness, and self-regulation. Our relationship was strained because I felt like I could never do anything right. I was always disciplining her or putting out fires, and it felt like we were stuck in a cycle of frustration, anger, and tears.

Marisa didn’t just address the behaviors; she truly understood my daughter and gave us the tools to reconnect. Through OT, my daughter has transformed into a completely different kid. She’s learning how to process her emotions, communicate her needs appropriately, and regulate her behaviors. Marisa created a safe space for her to grow, and I can honestly say she saved our relationship.

I will forever be grateful for Marisa and the work she does. She’s compassionate, knowledgeable, and the kind of support every family deserves. Thank you, Marisa, for giving me my relationship with my daughter back. If you’re looking for someone to support your child’s development or struggling with similar challenges,  Marisa is the kind of professional every family deserves. She has been a true blessing to both of my children, and the impact she’s had on our lives is more than I could even express.",2025-01-24 14:01:48,8 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUaT0NkECLfGn8oXb_bi17aeKHOFGndKS5ydD3INOKchZR7XxRfQA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:19:10.966303,,

I learned so much about my own relationship with them, how my interactions influence their behavior, and how to confidently handle different situations.

Serenity K-9,(813) 399-0909,ChIJkarFu-fXwogRb792GnIH_Rc,Elizabeth Farrell,5,"I cannot recommend Kevin enough for his exceptional work as a dog trainer, particularly for dogs with complex challenges. We met Kevin by chance while he was training dogs at Lowe’s, and it was immediately clear that he has a remarkable gift for understanding and working with “broken” dogs. My German Shepherd, a service dog, struggled severely with anxiety, which often left me navigating environments carefully to avoid overwhelming him. Kevin’s expertise completely transformed our lives.

Kevin’s approach is nothing short of extraordinary. He didn’t just train my dog; he unlocked his potential, helping him learn to engage joyfully with other dogs and become part of a pack. The foundation Kevin built has given my dog a new lease on life, allowing him to thrive rather than merely exist in fear. While my dog will always have some anxiety, Kevin has equipped us with practical, effective strategies to manage it, fostering confidence and connection.

What sets Kevin apart is his commitment to ensuring owners are fully equipped to sustain the progress made. Unlike our previous experience with a trainer who provided minimal guidance post-training, Kevin requires follow-up sessions to teach owners how to maintain and build on the foundation he establishes. This has been a game-changer. In just 11 days since my dog returned home, we’ve made incredible strides, moving together more naturally and engaging in activities that ease his anxiety. Kevin’s training has not only made my dog happier but has also deepened our bond, making our time together more enjoyable than ever.

Kevin’s passion, expertise, and dedication have been a true blessing. Meeting him was a turning point for us, and I’m endlessly grateful for the positive impact he’s had on my dog and me.

Instead, he took the time to educate me on breeds, and how genetics and DNA can affect training and health.

When I was ready to get a dog, Kevin used his connections and knowledge to put me in contact with someone who had exactly what I was looking for.

Sit Means Sit Dog Training St. Petersburg,(727) 537-9721,ChIJpbYGN2X8wogRBflw7n_JuJw,Mikaela Walters,5,"I used to dread taking my dog out. She’s very large, very strong, and was very dog reactive. Having to use the elevator in the apartment was so scary. I was always worried the door would open and another dog would be on the other side. I would walk her super late at night to avoid seeing other people. I didn’t trust her. It made me so sad because I know she’s a great dog, she just didn’t know how to manage her big emotions. She was very easily excited and I could tell she just didn’t know how to process it. Pair that with a bad experience at a dog park (don’t go!), and she was lunging and barking and very aggressive towards dogs. She would drag me wherever she wanted to go.
Then we met Mark and angel at sit means sit. We did a 3 day board and train and kept up with the group classes. I have shed tears at her transformation. Being able to take her to get coffee with me again. Walking down busy central avenue with her walking right next to me on a loose leash. She knew a lot of “tricks” previously, but would never be able to do more than sit in public because she was so unfocused. She has been transformed. I thank Mark and Angel so much for this. If you are on the fence, do it. Having a trusting relationship with your dog, with focus and calm, is such a huge quality of life improvement for both of us. I get to enjoy having her again. I get to enjoy how smart she is. And learn even more with her. And she can enjoy life again, not being scared and overstimulated by everything.

Sit Means Sit Dog Training Tampa,(813) 505-1337,ChIJC_bQ9w7BwogRLEUjGyEolok,Deborah Guillen,5,"I am absolutely thrilled to share my experience with the incredible dog training company Sit Means Sit who has worked wonders with my 5-year-old adopted German Shepherd. Adopting an older dog often comes with unique challenges, but thanks to the expertise and dedication of this company, my journey has been nothing short of miraculous.
From the very first consultation, it was evident that Kris possessed an exceptional understanding of canine behavior, particularly with rescue dogs. Kris and Tina took the time to get to know my dog's history, temperament, and specific needs, crafting a personalized training program that addressed every concern I had.
My German Shepherd had struggled with reactive issues, but the trainer's patient and compassionate approach made all the difference. Their positive reinforcement techniques, combined with clear and consistent guidance, helped my dog gain confidence and trust in a remarkably short time.
One of the most impressive aspects of the training was the focus on strengthening the bond between me and my dog. Kris and Tina not only taught my German Shepherd essential commands and good manners but also educated me on how to communicate effectively with him.
The progress my dog has made is truly astounding. He is now well-behaved, responsive, and much more relaxed in various environments. The transformation has been so profound that friends and family often comment on how well-trained my German Shepherd appears.
In addition to the remarkable results, Kris and Tina’s professionalism and dedication are commendable. They were always well-prepared and always invested in my dog's success. Their passion for their work shines through, making the training experience enjoyable and rewarding for both me and my dog.
I totally recommend Sit Means Sit and cannot express enough gratitude for the amazing training I received. Their expertise, kindness, and unwavering commitment have changed my German Shepherd for the better. If you are looking for a trainer who can make a real difference in your dog's behavior and overall well-being, look no further.

Sit Stay Dog Training USA,(954) 709-4875,ChIJVTCRKg8H2YgR-o1gyQyfHnk,Lishann E,5,"My dog's life, and mine, changed the day we met Alberto.

We’ve known him for over five years now, ever since we brought our dog home. From day one, he was so much more than a dog sitter. He just got her. It was like he spoke her language. He helped train her, and over the years, he’s been there for everything — whether we were heading out of town or she just needed a playdate. It didn’t matter if it was late, a weekend, or even a holiday — Alberto always said yes. That kind of reliability gave us such peace of mind.

Then everything changed. Our sweet girl was diagnosed with a serious medical condition, and suddenly, finding help became incredibly hard. Most people either hesitated or said no outright. But not Alberto. When we told him, he didn’t even flinch. He said yes, with this calm, steady confidence that instantly put us at ease. He took on her care like it was no big deal — same love, same attention, just with some extra steps.

Even after we moved half an hour away, we never even considered looking for someone else. We still make the drive because there’s no one else we trust with her.

Today, his support meant more than ever. We lost our dog unexpectedly — a heartbreaking shock for our family. In the middle of all that pain, Alberto was there. He didn’t just help us through the difficult moments — he showed up with real compassion and care. His kindness made a really hard day just a little bit easier, and we’re so grateful for that.

If you’re looking for someone to care for your dog — especially if they have special needs — I honestly can’t recommend Alberto enough. He doesn’t just watch dogs. He loves them like they’re his own. He’s dependable, trustworthy, and one of the kindest people we’ve ever met.

Words cannot express the person and therapist that Jennifer is. Jennifer leads every session with a smile on her face, listening ears, and an open heart that doesn’t judge. Jennifer ensures she sets you up for success by giving you task/homework you can do outside of therapy to solve the issue you may be having, or to help find the reason it is occurring. My favorite thus far has been the ‘beneath the iceberg’ which helped locate the actual reason behind certain emotions. She is the most understanding person and knows life gets in the way. She has changed her schedule to accommodate me more times than I can count given my busy schedule. She always has a positive ‘we can do this’ attitude which has me leaving every session with a positive outlook on the situation at hand. Jennifer is also LGBT friendly and doesn’t judge. For this reason, I not only use her for personal therapy but for marriage as well. She is able to separate the two perfectly and give sound advice. This review and those beneath mine do not scratch the surface of the experience you will have with her. Front staff is nice and were quick to get me in.",2024-12-18 05:14:46,9 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLtHk19oBeib_SodyecWPFKN6UDk4Si_wws9GCTDyhWdKdj7g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:19:22.502192,,

Maybe Smart Body has a few hiccups in the booking/reception area, like just about any business right now. But there are some very strong individuals working that area picking up the slack, and that will NOT affect your health care.

We have two dogs - a SUPER ENERGETIC chihuahua puppy (Chiqui) and an older STUBBORN AND REACTIVE shih tzu mix (Winston) - both desperately in need of basic obedience and good manners. Just one session with David at Smart Start Puppies and we saw an IMMEDIATE change in both the dog behavior and our own!

Smart Start Puppies equipped us with all the tools we need to become more confident and responsible dog parents. Two months later and the dogs are completely different dogs - not only are they more obedient and reliable, they seem genuinely happier. Training a dog is not for the faint of heart and it takes a lot of discipline but with Smart Start Puppies you’ll have one on one support and a network of super talented, patient and knowledgeable training experts at your disposal to hold you accountable and help you achieve success.

If you love your pups but need help getting them under control or have more advanced needs like therapy or service dog training, call Smart Start Puppies. Everyone at Smart Start is amazing - David, Brianna and Julie, to name a few - and they’re all genuinely excited to help you create the dog of your dreams. Not only are they kind and passionate about what they do, they’re legit experts in the field of dog training. If you’re on the fence, just jump in - Smart Start Puppies is worth EVERY penny and my only regret is that I waited so long to call them!

And special shout-out to David - he's a real gem. Not only is he patient, understanding, smart and super kind, he's a straight shooter and one of the most honest and humble people we've ever met. David gave us homework starting on day one and consistently checked in on us, and no matter how busy he was he always made time for us...and the best part is that he held us accountable (THANK YOU!!). David gave us the confidence we needed to take control of our dogs and ultimately our lives, and for that we're forever grateful.",2024-05-07 17:32:49,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyowJjthlzsTI_JU3va5YMKa14cgJTetxHQ70All0eZ7YPI3Z5eQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:19:27.888483,,

Ollie not only responded well to Tony’s techniques but actually enjoyed the training process. Tony helped build Ollie’s confidence while giving me the tools I needed to feel more confident as a dog owner. Whether we were working on leash manners, commands, or addressing anxiety, Tony always made it feel manageable and encouraging.

He has a calm, grounded energy that dogs pick up on immediately and that energy carries over to the people he works with too.

So definitely not customer service oriented. Won't ever go back.

I’ve been bringing my dog to this salon since long before it became Smoochie Pooch, and it used to be our absolute favorite place for grooming. I was always happy to pay the higher prices because the quality and care were worth it.

Unfortunately, since the transition from Charlie’s Place to Smoochie Pooch, the experience has changed drastically. The new hours—Monday through Friday, 8AM to 4PM—are completely unrealistic for working pet owners. When I called to cancel my dog’s pre-scheduled appointments, I was asked if I could take time off work. Take off work... to get my dog groomed? That’s just not reasonable.

It’s incredibly disappointing to see a once-wonderful salon become so inaccessible. We truly miss Charlie’s Place and the flexibility and care they provided.

The atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between professional and friendly, which makes each visit a positive experience. This is actually my third time using SoFlo PT for my therapy needs.

Facilities:
The “Rehab North” location is spotless and well organized. All shared equipment—machines, tables, free weights, etc.—is thoroughly cleaned after every use.

Physical Therapy:
I was impressed that SoFlo PT was able to schedule my first appointment within just a few days. That quick start made a real difference, since my vertigo was beginning to interfere with daily life.

My case was assigned to Dr. Hunter Thompson. With her expertise and hands-on approach, she evaluated my condition and designed a treatment plan that included the Epley maneuver, balance exercises, and light resistance training. Each session was carefully tailored to my progress, and I noticed a major improvement in my balance after only a couple of visits.

The Good News:
Today (09/25/25), I “graduated” from my PT program! I’ve made tremendous progress, and the difference in my daily life is remarkable.

Final Thoughts:
Overall, I couldn’t be happier with the care and results I received. I highly recommend SoFlo PT to anyone in need of physical therapy. On a personal note, I’ll truly miss the staff, who became like extended family over the past two months. Best wishes to everyone! Special thanks also to Dr. Carson Kutuchief, the owner, for leading an excellent practice that clearly puts patients first.

I rode twice a day for five days on 3 different horses. All of them were schoolmasters who immediately let me know what was working and what wasn’t. The focus on my riding position has never been as spot on as it was last week. I immediately “felt” my adductors and lower obliques getting turned on. That was a first! The instruction was clear, concise and consistent. It made sense and it worked. On my final day I was literally in tears. Tears of joy and truly a wide variety of emotions, that I would never have anticipated. Not only did I feel on top of the world as a rider, but I also felt a new sense of joy and purpose, both in and out of the saddle. So much that leaving was hard.

They celebrate her wins, encourage her through challenges, and always push her to be her best in a way that builds confidence and love for the sport.

Their dedication goes beyond just lessons--they take the time to understand her goals, strengths, and even the little things that make her feel supported. They want her to succeed just as much as we do, and that means the world. It's rare to find trainers who are this passionate, patient, and committed to their students, but that's exactly what we found here.

The facility is amazing. Stunning in fact! Both locations are clean, well-run, and full of happy, well-cared-for horses. It's a place where riders and horses thrive, and you can feel the love and dedication in everything they do. The staff is superb. I can honestly say from the moment we met everyone, we knew we had found our home away from home.

And the horse they found for my daughter? Absolute perfection. They didn't just find a good horse; they found the right horse--one that fits her personality, skill level, and dreams perfectly. From day one, it was clear they were meant to be together. She's kind, talented, and everything we could have hoped for and more. Watching them grow together has been the most incredible experience, and we are beyond grateful to Vitor and Maggie for making that happen.

I purchased Max, my two year/two month German Shepard from Jennifer in December of 2017 and till this day I cannot thank her enough. Max is such a great dog and he’s freakishly athletic. Everywhere I go I’m always asked how did I get him to be in such great shape and/or how beautiful he is. Luckily he’s never had any issues health wise either. It’s not for nothing but a shepherd from this breeder clearly stands out compared to other Shepard’s you may come across.

When I found an injured Eastern Screech Owl, I reached out to them expecting some basic guidance. Instead, they immediately offered to drive all the way up to pick up the owl themselves — no hesitation, no excuses, just pure dedication.

After the rescue, they sent me a detailed update explaining exactly what they found and how they were treating it. Their team performed a full medical assessment, provided pain relief, fluids, and antibiotics, and kept the owl in their ICU under constant observation. They even mentioned that radiographs would be done if needed. It was clear from their communication that this wasn’t just routine — they genuinely cared about giving the owl the best chance to recover and return to the wild.

What really stands out about South Florida Wildlife Center is their professionalism and compassion. They handle every animal like it matters, and they take the time to educate and keep you informed. They’re a nonprofit that runs entirely on community support, yet they operate like a world-class wildlife hospital.

If you ever find injured wildlife or want to support an organization that truly makes a difference, this is the one.

Gunner was in severe pain, later diagnosed as a spinal infection. He weighed nearly 100 pounds, and any attempt to lift him caused intense distress—he cried out and bit me several times.

Moments later, they reversed course and said I’d have to bring him in myself.

I found another vet willing to come to my home. Gunner passed away on May 5.

Southeast Veterinary Neurology,(305) 274-2777,ChIJ1zYNGd3A2YgRATIA1adF3C0,g watson,5,"I can’t thank Southeast Veterinary Neurology (SEVN) enough for their outstanding care, professionalism, and compassion during one of the most stressful times for me and my dog. From the very first call, I felt heard and supported. I spoke with their intake team for nearly an hour on a Sunday, and not once did I feel rushed. They patiently listened, asked thoughtful questions, and took detailed notes about my dog’s condition.

My dog had been experiencing intense neck pain after being attacked by a large off-leash dog that grabbed him by the neck. His primary vet performed X-rays, which showed inflammation around his C5 vertebra, and prescribed two weeks of crate rest and medication. When there was no improvement, I was referred directly to SEVN by another vet for specialized neurological care. I called on a Sunday and had an appointment scheduled for Tuesday—remarkably fast. Their team was responsive, flexible, and proactive in their communication every step of the way.

When we arrived, my dog underwent a neurological exam and MRI, and later that same day, he went into surgery for a slipped disc at C4–C5. It was a whirlwind experience, but the SEVN team kept me grounded. They provided frequent updates, shared photos, and took the time to explain everything in clear, reassuring terms. Their transparency and compassion made an incredibly difficult situation more manageable.

He was discharged three days later, and although still in recovery, he’s clearly improving and more comfortable. The procedure and hospitalization were significant undertakings—emotionally and financially—but I truly believe SEVN helped prevent further suffering and provided the expert care he urgently needed.

Dr. Kornberg, thank you for your expertise and for walking me through my dog’s diagnosis and treatment plan with such clarity and care. And to the kind team members at reception who handled my initial call—I wish I remembered your names!—thank you for your patience and warmth. You set the tone for everything that followed.

A few suggestions to enhance the experience for future pet parents:
Clearer Cost Expectations: While I did receive an initial estimate, offering a broader pricing range—including high-end possibilities—would help families better prepare financially and reduce stress when urgent decisions arise.
More Transparency Around Surgical Timing: I didn’t realize that surgery might occur immediately after the MRI. Knowing this in advance would have helped me feel more mentally and emotionally prepared, especially for the possibility of leaving my dog for several days.
Enhanced Pre-Visit Communication: Providing a clear outline of what the initial consultation may involve—such as same-day imaging and potential surgery, estimated recovery timelines, and hospitalization length—would empower pet parents to feel more informed and confident throughout the process.
I’m very fortunate that my partner and I were able to prioritize our dog’s care when he needed it most. The financial commitment was significant, and the experience was emotionally intense—but SEVN made it all feel possible. Their specialized, compassionate approach was exactly what my dog needed, and I’m endlessly grateful to have been referred to them when we were.",2025-05-13 14:59:47,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX7CjiKJeSNjA8DlXehUuy2nAwLbnt4DcSNT9BVl6gmYTfLDBwH=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:19:44.134638,,

Our cat had a tumor and they strongly recommended chemotherapy instead of surgery.

We agreed to that plan, but only after they specifically told us that the dosage would be administered slowly in order to minimize side effects and not degrade the cats overall quality of life, as the treatment takes about 12 weeks or so.

After the second week of treatment, our cat could not stop vomiting and having constant diarrhea, and then our cat became so sick that she went 4 days without eating and had to be taken to the emergency animal hospital for treatment.

How on earth does that kind of treatment plan help maintain quality of life for your cat???

Southeast Veterinary Oncology and Internal Medicine - SEVOMED,(904) 278-3870,ChIJa4dnK23G5YgRr_QfxnhfoxU,Don H,1,"My cat had a nasal tumor late last year and we were advised by our local Savannah vet to speak to PetCure regarding Stereotactic radiation if we wanted to pursue that avenue. We arranged a video consultation with Dr Molly Holmes. She explained our options and her concerns that his prognosis might not be as long since our boy was older and had previously had surgery to remove a portion of his lung earlier that year. The phone calls and the consultation all went according to plan and everyone called when they said they would. Treatment plans and payment plans were set up and we elected to proceed with the radiation as it was really our only choice to extend our cat's life.

My disappointment is with the aftercare or  lack of it. He seemed to suffer horribly from the treatment and really didn't improve as techs or the doctor thought he could or should. We brought him two to three times a week to our local vet to seek some advice. Although he told us this was way out of his wheelhouse, he offered us advice and empathy. His frustration with PetCure/SEVO was apparent when he reached out to them to express how they had not been there for him or for us.

We made the two and a half hour trek down to Orange Park multiple times to be seen by Dr Tisdelle. I have no clue who Dr Haas is in these reviews as we never heard her name once. We were told that Dr Holmes (who does the radiation remotely) was actually in the Orange Park office one day while we were there with Muffy and she did not even make an effort to meet us in person.

We let our beautiful boy go in February of this year after suffering for 3 months with radiation side effects and not improving the way we were told he should have. He was exhausted from the constant medications being shoved down his throat, in his eye and up his nose around the clock and so were we. Sadly, it is now July and not one single individual from this office has reached out to us in any way to offer condolences or even send a sympathy card. I don't even know if they are aware he died. How quick and efficient they were at the beginning when payment plans were discussed. Absolutely disappointing from a human standpoint where a little support, empathy and outreach would have gone a long way.  Rest in peace Muffy.

I had a bad feeling about this place from the start, especially when instead of being brought to the back in a private room, a nurse will come out and publicly discuss your pets condition in front of the entire filled lobby. They only send you back to the room when it's time to discuss payment. When the doctor finally came in to ""talk"" to me, she left without thoroughly explaining all of my treatment options. Instead, a nurse came in with 3-5 different  options, but the doctor never took the time to walk me through each one. I am not a medical professional and I need guidance and understanding of each choice of treatment, not just numbers thrown at me on a paper and say ""pick"". I had anxiety and asked a nurse to help me but she panicked too and said ""I have no idea"" and it always turned into a battle of her running back and forth between me and the doctor rather than the doctor just assisting me. Given how high and variable the costs are for each option, I would have appreciated it if Dr. Haas had personally explained all of them. Instead, the nurse just ran back and forth, which felt extremely unfair, especially considering I paid $110 for a ""recheck consultation"" each time. To make matters worse, they repeatedly got my pet’s prescriptions wrong, kept pushing me off on ""temporary doctors"" that were in the office because Dr. Haas was ""busy"". and put her on the wrong course of treatment which ultimately killed her. I truly believe that if I would have taken her elsewhere she would still be alive. They gamble with pet's lives too easily.

The staff at this location are all very compassionate and caring of animals. I took my little Fritter in over some back pain on the weekend. They had hoped it was treatable with medication. Sadly it was not. I came back with Fritter late at night on Monday after he lost function in his legs. Dr Lind arrived at 10-11pm to care for Fritter and run MRIs and check ups on him. She's very thorough and makes sure you are fully informed of your options before proceeding.
I am very grateful places like this exist. I felt like my world had come to an end very suddenly and they've given me hope I might still have some time with my Fritter after a little TLC.

Elena was our last therapist, and she always took her time after each session to talk to me and share updates.

I grew to trust and like her therapist very much, as my daughter is not easy to manage at times. After about 2 years, the therapist requested to have sessions with my daughter ALONE.
I was fine with it, by now the therapists knew her well, and was aware of the SIBS and occasional aggressive stimming. Idk what happened in that room, but the therapist cut short the session, as my daughter began banging her head, and scratching the therapist. The therapist was shaken, but began making a bunch of medical assumptions and recommendations about my daughters sibs,  even though she already sees trained medical doctors for the issue.
As far as im aware, this is the FIRST incident, in 3 years, the company decided to cut off my daughters services, with no parents meetings or input as to how to possibly remedy the situation, such as, having me come back in the room, even though the therapist did request alone sessions.
They took it upon themselves to cut her services, without any type of meetings or talks.
This obviously is not in the best interest of the child, is extremely cold, and will stunt her progress as it was, and well, not to mention any bond she had with that therapist, gone. I would recommend you find a company more apt to work with parents through these incidents through communication, rather than just a cut off.

Speech Pathways of St. Johns,(904) 834-1336,ChIJYTICtaXN5YgRDIaRKNMF_pY,K. R.,5,"We recently moved from out of state and had very big shoes to fill when it came to finding a new speech therapist for our daughter. We were looking for a place that not only had experience but also felt personal…somewhere that didn’t feel clinical or rushed and where we wouldn’t just be a number.

From the moment we walked into Speech Pathways of St. Johns, we knew we had found something special. After just two sessions, it already feels like we’re part of their little speech therapy family. The environment is warm, welcoming, and truly centered around the individual needs of each child.

Karissa is not your typical speech therapist. She took a genuine interest in our daughter’s entire history, asked thoughtful questions, and truly listened to everything I shared. She involved me in the care plan from the very beginning and even handed me a pen to adjust the goals together. What meant the most to me as a mom was how seriously she took my daughter’s medical sensitivities. Karissa went above and beyond to make her space safe and comfortable, even making changes to the environment to help my daughter. She’s followed up outside of sessions with such genuine care and concern, checking in to see how my daughter was doing and how she could support her better. That level of care is so rare and such a gift.

After both sessions, I walked out in happy tears…tears of relief and gratitude. Finding someone who understands your child, listens to your concerns, and cares deeply is everything. Even the other staff members we’ve met have been just as kind and genuine.

If you’re looking for a holistic, child-centered approach to speech therapy, this is the place. They see the whole child and value the parent’s role in the process. My daughter usually takes a long time to warm up, but she was already talking to Karissa during the first session. Karissa has a way of connecting that makes kids feel safe and comfortable.

One of my biggest worries with our move was finding a new SLP, and I can now say with confidence that we found exactly what we needed.

Ms Ana is an eternal optimist and an expert at play therapy. What started with blowing bubbles to get the “p” sound and understand “pop” has become endless learning, talking and playing. E is so engaged in his sessions each week. Whether they’re reading books, playing with the farm, cooking in the play oven, or singing songs, he just loves his Ms Ana. I’m glad I trusted her to develop E’s comprehension and language before working on his speech. He is excelling under her guidance, care and patience.

I didn’t like the fact that they keep changing therapists without my knowledge. I only found out because I ran into my child’s “new” therapist in the lobby. How are they supposed to know his progress if they kept changing the therapist. They expect you to confirm appointments every time. But couldn’t advise me whenever they’ll change his therapist! I called their attention about it twice and I got a rude response from the front staff. Never had the owner contact me or at least apologize for the inconvenience to let me know what was going on. It was just a horrible experience and I honestly wouldn’t recommend it. You’re there to help your child progress but I guess they only cared about the charging the insurance.,2024-06-28 19:26:58,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbJyDpagWBDyl9aPseBqyVxzCF7M-VD23MMhSl4NoF8qH-nfkAdg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:20:09.852911,,

Spellers Center Tampa - Occupational Therapy for Nonverbal Individuals with Autism/ Apraxia,(727) 275-1155,ChIJRQPn5ueTwogRvy5i4FMDAwk,M.L. S,5,"I first took my adult nonspeaking autistic son to Spellers October 11, 2023. I was very skeptical and was surprised that Melanie spoke directly to Paul almost as if I were not present. She was very encouraging to him, and he was soon Spelling. I was blown away when she asked him what the capital of Delaware was and he spelled out DOVER!
I didn't know that!
Melanie has always treated Paul with utmost respect and PATIENCE...she is very encouraging to him and makes sure he knows that she is proud of him...even through his most dysregulated days.
She always successfully helps Paul to
de escalate when he has violent outbursts of self injury and brings him back to continue his session.
Paul and I lost our home and belongings to the hurricanes last fall. We evacuated after the flood from Helene, then had to evacuate from Milton. I knew I had to get him back to Spellers ASAP after our evacuation to Georgia, to get some stability into his life. His life was turned completely upside down in one night, causing trauma, which increased his bouts of self injury. Melanie was extremely accommodating and got him right in for a session. That was the first time I had seen him smile in days. 🥰
I simply cannot say enough good about Spellers of Tampa and Melanie in particular.
Bringing Paul to Spellers is the best decision I have ever made for my son. We have grown closer because  I have come to understand him better and  he knows that I understand and support him. I now KNOW for a fact that  he is in there... after hoping and praying for 30+ years that he was.

What a beautiful pony, and actually the horses here all looked incredibly well looked after. The place itself is deceptively large - it's much bigger than what it looks like from the road! It's one of the most beautiful and well kept facilities I've seen, whilst remaining quite authentic - it felt like we were part of a movie set. A variety of fenced off paddock areas and stable/barn areas really nicely done. Sara even had an opportunity to groom and wash Mickey after her lesson! And fed him treats too.

I don’t even know how to begin putting this into words… but I’ll try.

Almost two years bedridden… ten knee surgeries… both legs crushed and fractured in a way most people will never understand. I had doctors telling me I’d never walk again. I had therapists treating me like I was already done. I lost hope. I lost myself. I felt like my life was over.

And then… I met Norman.

Norman didn’t just treat me—he believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself.
He took on my case when most would’ve walked away.
He worked with me one-on-one, with more care, knowledge, and dedication than I could’ve ever imagined.

Because of Norman, I am walking pain-free today.
Because of Norman, I got my freedom, my confidence, and my life back.
Because of Norman, I was able to move back to Tampa with hope in my heart again.

I’ve been through dozens of therapists before, and let me tell you—no one comes close. Norman isn’t just another therapist reading from a book—he lives this, breathes this, and fights for every single one of his patients like family.

So if you’re reading this and feel like you’ve hit a wall, like you’ll never get better—go see Norman. He gave me my life back, and I know he can do the same for you.

Thank you, Norman. I truly owe it all to you.
If you’re reading this and thinking twice—don’t. Go see Norman. You’ll thank yourself later.",2025-05-12 12:58:24,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWTrAgfEYIobBFF-lXmdwt8zh8jpkwzRhJH0tJeb926of9sT-qJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:20:18.320861,,

Turns out one of discs has eroded away and was causing me terrible back pain. For months I had to crawl out of bed because my pain was so severe. On my first appointment w/ Norman, he was able to identify some areas to focus on and properly diagnose what was causing me pain. In subsequent sessions Norman provided me with several exercises and stretches to alleviate my back pain.

After only a few weeks the pain was reduced significantly, I can get out of bed in the morning with only minor discomfort and each day gets better and better. This was a huge relief as I thought I’d have to live with this pain the rest of my life.

I feel so blessed that I chose Spring Gardens Recovery. I had no prior knowledge of where to go, and as my first rehab experience I was honestly terrified. From the very first call, the admissions staff were kind and patient, answering every question and making me feel comfortable and welcome.

From the moment I arrived, the entire team went above and beyond. The staff truly feel like family—they know your name, care about your story, and give you personal attention every step of the way. The setting is close-knit and never overcrowded, so I never once felt like just a number or a statistic. Instead, it felt like home.

In my 30 days there I learned and grew more than I ever thought possible. The therapists and group leaders were incredible, and the camaraderie with the other clients brought so much laughter and support. Even the food deserves a shout-out—the chefs make every meal with care and it honestly makes a huge difference when you’re going through something so big.

My time at Spring Gardens changed my life and made the process of coming off my substance something I’ll never forget—in the best way. I loved it so much that I decided to continue with their aftercare program, HOPE Gardens, through PHP, IOP, and OP. That turned out to be another amazing decision, because it was like an extension of Spring Gardens and helped me keep growing and learning.

The alumni events they host are also fantastic. They give you chances to stay connected, keep friendships alive, and build a lifelong support network.

If you’re lost or stuck in the throws of addiction  and looking for a place where you will be truly cared for, heard, and treated like family, Please chose Spring Gardens Recovery… It’s the place to be.

Also, I was charged an arm and a leg for tiny amounts of medicine that they know can easily spill, and then they charge you again! They tried to pass this off as .5ml, when it's actually. 4.

From my first visit, the staff made me feel cared for, understood, and supported.

Dr. Davis took the time to explain my injuries in a way I could understand and developed a treatment plan that was tailored to my needs. Each adjustment, therapy session, and recommendation has helped me make steady progress. The improvement I’ve experienced in my pain levels, mobility, and quality of life has been truly life-changing.

Beyond their clinical skill, the entire office is compassionate, professional, and genuinely dedicated to their patients. They treat you like a person, not just a number. I’m incredibly grateful for the care I’ve received — their support has played a huge role in my recovery and helped me stay hopeful during a very difficult time.

If you’re dealing with chronic pain or recovering from an injury, I highly recommend st Germain Chiropractic.",2025-07-02 18:44:49,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWze8P1gt4pAdELbGhDzWt_RCeYZcazalLtNDFUCYoU3igOpLCD=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:20:26.169235,,

My son was struggling with significant behavioral issues, and his school referred us to Star Psychology. After Dr. Shey conducted the initial evaluation at the school, we were offered group therapy sessions. That’s when everything started to change—not just for my son, but for me as a father.

Through these sessions, I began to understand how and where I was dropping the ball. I’m not ashamed to accept accountability for my actions—and my inaction. Alongside my wife, I completed a 6-week course on play therapy, where I learned how to connect with my son through structured play. To my surprise, he absolutely loves it.

More importantly, I discovered principles and values I had been missing. I learned to slow down, to be more intentional, and to truly focus on my son in every aspect of his life. These changes have transformed not just his behavior, but our relationship.

If you’re a father reading this, please know—it’s okay to feel like you don’t have all the answers. I thought I was doing everything right: being a good provider, checking all the boxes. But I had slipped into autopilot. I became routine and robotic. I wasn’t being the daddy my son needed.

Step Beyond Development,(727) 643-7695,ChIJ2ZK0MdvzwogRDYV5qUvTM0A,Abrams Family,5,"We started our child here at only 18 months old, and 5 stars isn’t enough. Everyone was saying not to send her because ABA can be controversial, but if I had listened to peers/family, she would likely be nonverbal to this day. Her developmental pediatrician was adamant it would help her. She was completely nonverbal when she started here. Not even gestures and severe behavior issues. Within weeks of starting she was gesturing, and by 2 years old she was considered verbal. After outpatient therapy failed initially (for us, for others it may be the right fit), ABA was the solution. Not only did our insurance cover it with zero issues, any billing issue we had after starting (our insurance’s fault) was diligently resolved by Pam, and she worked with me on a big issue with up to 10 calls a day to ensure it was all taken care of. When we decided to finally pull our daughter to get some extra OT/PT/ST to give her a different environment before prek3 started, we realized that the help she was getting from ABA was so vital to her growth that we are now doing a hybrid of both until she starts prek3. We will likely be back every summer till she’s 18 if she needs it, but I don’t see us needing them much longer since they truly got her to being in a place where only we can notice her issues and those issues that are left are things that can be chalked up to toddlerhood.

They built a very positive rapport with our son, which enabled them to address difficult behaviors and issues.

While ABA therapy is a substantial time commitment, it is effective, which we saw firsthand with our son.

When my newborn refused to take a bottle, and I had to return to work, it was such a stressful time. I tried dozens of different bottles, feeding positions, rooms in the house, lactation consultants, handing the baby off to my husband or other family members, and nothing worked. I had resigned myself to being stuck forever in breastfeeding jail for the rest of time.

Stephanie listened to me with such understanding and empathy and took time to observe. She held my little one with the most gentle, caring touch, and had him drinking from the bottle almost immediately. I (only half-joking) asked her to move in with me, but she declined.

We were referred to Sunny Pediatric Services through our pediatrician and Early Steps. Annika and Mari were at our initial evaluation and I immediately was validated with several concerns I had. I was blown away with the gentle but thorough exam and explanations. They took the time to not just hear me but to LISTEN and explain why I was seeing these issues and what his initial plan of treatment would be. They were very proactive with their recommendations and setting the goals realistically, and PUSHING my son to smash them. They have been SO flexible with scheduling and being able to come to our home or more recently our daycare at the times that work for our boy. Our current team is Annika, Lauren, Saint Claire, and Mari and I love love LOVE their ability to respect my son's boundaries when he communicates he needs a break or is ready to be done while at the same time pushing him for just a leeetle bit more and showing him what his body can really DO. One of our favorite Saint Claire-isms is ""Our hands CAN!"". Jamie always giggles when he hears it (which has become often 😅). Annika was essential in helping us find a bottle that worked well with his lip tie (the Joovy Boob) and getting evaluated with Dr. Shawn. I can always tell what he and Mari have been working on because it's the new thing he masters that week 😂 and he has picked up so many new mouth sounds AND DADA since we started working with Lauren (and Betsy). He works SO HARD for all of our ladies and they inspire that in him. I could say SO MANY GOOD THINGS but I will end with they are a pure joy to work with and it will be bittersweet when our time is over.

The knowledge, patience, compassion, education, and just overall incredible care that we have received from Brittney C. with OT and the rest of the team have been a true answer to prayer. We have gone from learning to eat with specialty bottles, utensils, cups, and even feeding himself with ST to teaching us how to conquer the big behaviors with OT from not being able to communicate with us to now having expected behavior for his age and saying anything he wants. They have introduced us to so many additional resources to help us navigate the phases of a child with a cleft lip & palate that I know would not have been possible without them.

His first week there he amazed me when he start crawling down the hallway at home. He enjoys playing with others and loves to crawl all over his classroom.  My son is able to drink out of a cup with or without a straw. I like how they allow the kids to express themselves first then help them in way that is comfortable for them. They also have a great therapist team . Such as PT OT and speech. My son has never liked therapy before he would always cry but now he’s happy also he loves his cuddles. I also like how the staff and nurses treat the kids like they are there’s and that all kids are treated the same with love.

From the day my daughter was 3 months old ( she is now 13 months) , she has been attending this day center. They are great from the staff to the students , they are very professional !!! Also very nurturing , they tend to every need of the child and love on them as if they are their own !! ITS A VERY CLEAN ENVIORMENT I MUST ADD !! Rarely does my child get sick or have any issues like other daycares. It takes a village to raise these kids and extra love and patience with special medical needs. They are on top of everything , from sending notes home when the kids need things to verbally letting me know if there is anything i need to do for recertification. Never have i had any issues !! Christmas time came and they did Secret Santa , my child received gifts did arts and crafts and also pictures with the Christmas Tree (same for Thanksgiving). They are very involved with every student there. They also provide therapy that my child needs so she doesn't have to go anywhere else for services , everything is inhouse , i love it and it makes it convenient !! The therapist also sends picture mail and videos of progress which always makes my day seeing that when my daughter started she was a little little baby less then 8lbs and now she 25lbs with the help of PPEC. Also in addition , THEY DO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION !!!! They have a bus that will pick them up and drop them off if ever transportation becomes a issue . Giselle is the woman in charge and she is very understanding and knowledgeable and Imani is 2nd in charge and she is great as well . They get the job done and are very responsible and organized sometimes more then me =)!!

They are really the best day center in the whole Broward Region . YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE!!!!!!",2024-02-17 20:36:52,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVCBeu2pqO6UZtSMfg1UBG_sCmHoUMjKSt0pe0w1zwvGr0RMv4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:20:46.502905,,

Sweet Bee K9,(407) 954-5293,ChIJnbBCWKk53YgROcBfhvXeqVI,Slavka K,5,"Way before we were thinking of getting another puppy I knew that we would want him to be trained from the early stage of his life. I started to search for a Dog trainer in Florida area. When I came across the Sweet Bee K9 I immediately knew they would be the one. I reached out to Danielle and she responded right away. We even phoned back and forth. I had so many questions and she explained everything. I loved her personality and the enthusiasm about the dogs and training programs. After we got our GSP puppy, she recommended once a week personal one on one puppy training. We live 1,5h away from them and they did not hesitate for one minute and offered that they would come to us to do the training. The puppy training went absolutely amazing. Their patience with the puppy and especially with us :) was great. We and our GSP got a really good basic training foundation and he was ready to take the next step. Their 5 weeks Board and Train program. We dropped off our dog with Sweet Bee K9 and knew he is in good hands and didn’t have to worry about him.
When I say they exceeded our expectations is an understatement. Our dog is a complete different, well behaved dog. He sits when asked, stays in his place while how food is prepared, nicely next to us, loves to go to his crate for quiet time and for the night. We can’t be happier. The progress is remarkable.
If you have a dog that needs training don’t look any further, I highly recommend Sweet Bee K9 for the dog board and train program. Danielle’s and Larry’s passion for dogs and upbeat nature makes us feel like a family.

Danielle, her husband Larry and son Ty are such amazing, kind people. Danielle is so knowledgeable, breaks down the thought process of our canine friends and explains how to read and navigate their body language and needs so well. She is an advocate for our pets in making sure we understand their feelings when they can not communicate and tell us themselves.
She goes above and beyond to ensure your pet will be trained to appropriately handle high volume stimulation with social/distraction techniques and ensures your pet is socialized with other animals to lessen reactivity.
I am so happy we used Danielle for training, not only did we gain a friend but she’s now Meleys's “fun aunt” that she looks forward to seeing for daycare.
Love these wonderful humans, their teamwork, and the positive impact they bring to the animal lovers and vet communities.

Before Brittany, our son (ASD) had seen a number of speech therapists and she’s the only one who can get him to cooperate with her consistently. Our son often threw tantrums during ST sessions but he quickly warmed up to Brittany’s calm presence, patience and commitment to integrating fun into her therapy sessions. He’s been so receptive that we’ve added additional floor time therapy sessions at home so that he can further benefit from her services.

Brittany also provides speech therapy for our daughter at her daycare and works closely with the staff so that they have options on how to communicate with our daughter when she can’t articulate what she wants, needs or feels.

Brittany works well in communicating with other therapy providers and teachers, and makes sure that her speech goals align with whatever goals they might have. Our son’s developmental pediatrician consistently compliments his progress in communicating, and just keeps telling us to “keep doing what you’re doing.” Along with his other providers, we believe Brittany plays an integral role in his progress.

Sybil's Relaxation Station,(321) 557-3719,ChIJBeb4MHgT3ogR7GzxjKMEUXY,Mary Cieslak,1,"My husband purchased me a gift certificate from this location for Mother’s Day 2 years ago. I went to redeem today and was told the technician is no longer available so my certificate would not be honored. As a director of the largest spas in the world I find this to be extremely disappointing and illegal customer service. For an owner of a business to put the blame on me for not coming sooner (being a mother of toddlers this was the first time I had a moment to myself) was improper management of the situation. Had she explained the situation and offered a discount or some sort of resolution I would have been a client for life and I would have referred others as well. Instead she referred me to another spa, which tells me how dedicated she is to her own business. So since you do not know law on gift certificates let me educate you.

I purchased this gift certificate from your business, and it does not have an expiration date. Under federal and state consumer protection laws, gift certificates without expiration dates remain valid. The fact that the employee who sold it is no longer with you does not affect the business’s obligation to honor it.

Symmetry Physical Therapy,(305) 331-2277,ChIJA_W76Ju22YgRqvPikO-uQ8s,Cynthia Carle,5,"I highly recommend Symmetry Physical Therapy and this office.

After 18 months of intense pain, fear, and mobility restrictions following a bike vs. car accident (concussion, multiple disc herniations, two shoulder tears, intense muscle guarding, TMJ, injections, surgery, and rounds of PT at other providers), I immediately noticed Symmetry was different. Sessions are full 60-minute, truly one-on-one; meaning time is spent on careful assessment, hands-on treatment, and clear next steps rather than waiting or being split between multiple patients. The office is organized, responsive, and compassionate, which has reduced administrative insurance roadblocks and allowed my care to move forward. And Lisette sharing her cafecito during morning dry-needling sessions somehow makes a rough process feel calm and personable.

Dr. Fabrizio (“Fab”) Russo is an outstanding and charismatic provider and an even better human. From the outset he validated the severity of my pain and the frustration of limited progress whereas prior to the accident I did olympic weightlifting. He assured me there was no reason I should be 9 months post-op and unable to raise my arm overhead - and he’s been fully invested in my care since. As a woman, our pain is often minimized even by healthcare professionals. Fab takes it seriously and pairs compassion with a clear plan.  Treatment has combined manual therapy and myofascial work, scraping and cupping, heat and compression therapy, trigger point dry needling when appropriate, and a PT exercise program with thoughtful progression. I highly value his education and consultation: Fab explains mechanics in plain language and helps me distinguish tightness from weakness, when to rest versus strengthen, and when to press forward or ease off.

Progress has not been linear, but it has been real. In the past nine months I have advanced more than in the year and a half prior: I can walk and stand more comfortably, turn and support my head/neck with less restrictions, and complete daily tasks—walking my dog, carrying groceries, household chores—with noticeably less pain. Small milestones have been profoundly encouraging wins; a year ago I was crying in a store because I couldn’t reach the top shelf without excruciating pain; last month I was able to put my carry-on in overhead luggage comfortably.  Athletic ambitions are still a long way off, but I now have a stable path toward progression and an exceptional clinician + coach + accountability partner every step of the way.

For patients navigating complex, severe, and/or chronic injuries and who value consistent, individualized, one-on-one care Symmetry Physical Therapy and Dr. Fabrizio Russo have my gratitude and sincere recommendation.",2025-09-27 13:01:46,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWQQ84o_LN2Tid_7cUttdk9qoeIhsgbZiPivZ7hAJSyT05D-I8W=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:20:57.442359,,

I had the clinic send Dr. Rohter my dog's records so he could review them for me. He gave me his undivided attention and we had just a great conversation to help me understand what happened and to help me move toward closure with the loss of my loyal and loving companion of over 8 years.  I was on the fence about getting another pet after this last experience, but Dr. Rohter restored my confidence. I've clearly found a new vet clinic if we do decide to get another pet.

Jocelyn, with whom we have worked for more than 4 years, is incredibly sweet and professional, and Karyn has also been wonderful in her work with my son.

Like many places that serve children with special needs, TLC has faced some administrative and insurance-related changes in the past, which unfortunately created delays and confusion for some families. These situations were related to the transition period and not to the therapists themselves. From my experience, the team has been working hard to get everything back on track, and the quality of therapy has never been affected.

I can't say enough good things about Tyler and TM Canine Services. My dog Mongo (a super anxious chihuahua) had been struggling with some reactive behavioral challenges, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to help him. Enter Tyler—patient, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about dogs.

From the very first session some two years ago, Tyler connected with Mongo in a way that was both calming and effective. He took the time to understand Mongo’s unique personality and tailored the training to suit his needs. The transformation has been incredible. Mongo is more confident, responsive, and relaxed—and I feel empowered as a dog owner thanks to the tools and guidance Tyler provided.

In a recent pop-up session and with Tyler’s guidance, I was able to get Mongo to sit with another dog and even tolerate some tail wagging!

Tallahassee Counseling Center,(850) 385-9046,ChIJf5G4Cx1f7IgRxyB4Omkls-Y,Gabriella Medina,5,"I have worked with Shelly Mincy for quite some time now, and I can confidently say that she has been one of the most important sources of support in my life. Through some of my most challenging seasons—times when I felt overwhelmed, lost, or uncertain—Shelly provided a safe space where I could be heard, understood, and gently guided toward healing and clarity.

Her compassion is unmatched, and her calm, grounded presence always makes me feel at ease. What sets Shelly apart is not just her deep expertise and professionalism, but also the genuine kindness and empathy she brings into every session. She never makes you feel rushed or judged—instead, she listens with intent and responds with wisdom, patience, and care.

I honestly don’t know what I would have done without her support. She has helped me grow, process, and make peace with things I didn’t think I could get through. If you’re searching for a therapist who is truly invested in your well-being, who will walk alongside you with grace and insight, Shelly Mincy is the one. I’m endlessly grateful to have found her.",2025-07-16 13:24:05,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIy-52R5koH_WLm3u3P0DUgDor5pN1vtowmFlcmvOj7DkCM1A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:21:08.578870,,

In the past I was told I was too self aware to help. I spent years reading self help books specifically on my struggles, which helped but never undid the trauma stored in my nervous system. My obsession with self help and getting better made me more self critical. My other CBT therapists just told me “you’re so strong” and “that must be hard,” and to use my coping skills. CBT can actually make people with my conditions worse. I felt like every therapist just treated me like a sick puppy. Mike quite literally changed my life. Everyday was suffering up until I started seeing him about a year ago. I’ve always been afraid of men because of my past experiences, but Ive never felt judged or unsafe. I feel like I’m talking to the mentor I needed growing up. I truly believed I was beyond repair until EMDR. I  felt like I tried everything. He was highly recommended to me by multiple people. Life is hard but he’s helped me rewire my brain to become the person I always wanted to be. He taught me that above all else, I must be kind to myself.

The office and receptionist were wonderful and timely in the scheduling process. I'm sure the other therapists at this office are wonderful, as well, but the one I met with was not. Mike was polite and formal. He never openly made any negative statements, but his office did not feel like a safe space. I felt judged for my faith and beliefs from his facial expressions, and felt that he lacked the proper credentialing to treat my OCD and the nature of it. I was extremely nervous going in, and didn't feel that my courage in asking for help was acknowledged at all. At one point, he asked me why I was crying, and seemed to be at a loss as to why I was so emotional. It had been a long time since I had met with a therapist, and so everything had been bubbling up to the surface. Then, towards the end, he gave me a piece of paper with some cognitive behavioral therapy strategies and told me I would benefit from some memory therapy that they offered. That was it.

I don't like leaving low reviews, but, considering how much this experience has stayed with me, I thought it important enough to say something. This service provider did not seem prepared to assess adults, nor did she seem to take into account cultural differences (like parents who were in no way able to address social or sensory issues with a child when they were just trying to survive each day). I am a Black Woman and to say I was disappointed after going here, thinking I would be heard and safe, is an understatement. I fully agree with the other one-star reviews (one of which was oddly taken down a few days after I first saw it). In fact, the only time I felt validated during this process was when I read the other one-star reviews on here. That let me know it wasn't just me. I wish those reviews had been up when I was looking at this place for evaluation. The Dr. was very judgmental and told me I struggle maintaining relationships because my parents are divorced so no one modeled healthy relationships for me. What an awful thing to tell someone, as if marriages are guaranteed to be healthy and safe for the children. She seemed ready to dismiss everything I said, almost like ""Rainman-esque"" persons are the only ones who'll pass scrutiny. There seemed to be no consideration for 1) masking, 2) a spectrum of persons with a spectrum of qualifying behaviors, and 3) varying levels of functionality and growth as an adult (not a child, an adult).

We originally brought our son to them years ago, when he was around 2-3 years old, because we noticed some speech delay. The entire team took the time to customize each lesson and make sure the environment was there for him to feel comfortable and learn each and every time. After working with him, he progressed amazingly and we were able to graduate him at that time.

Fast forward to him turning eight years old, we realized that he could benefit from some support around his handwriting and reading comprehension. We proactively reached out to Julie for an assessment, and she immediately was able to guide us in the direction of what could help. In fact, we thought he might need guidance in another area as well, but she assessed that he was on track for it, so we only needed to focus on the other items - another example (of many) of how great and honest Julie is to work with. Our son is now enrolled in lessons for both reading comprehension and handwriting, and I can't tell you the amount of progress he has made over the last couple of months. Moving into third grade after a very disruptive period of time with e-learning and COVID, these lessons have made things so much easier on his day to day, as he is understanding the content so much better, not getting frustrated with himself at the amount of time or energy it was previously taking him to complete tasks and his confidence has boosted tremendously. Julie and her team do an amazing job of identifying the true need, and tailoring the guidance and lessons to that. I have recommended this team to many over the years and will continue to do so!

Even today there are things that I remind myself of that he told me that there is no quick fix to undo years of life experience. Having similar backgrounds in the military I found it extremely easy to relate and open up to him about what was going on in my personal life and therefore better to see results. He was the first person who made me realize I was important and that someone cared.

Our rescue Beagle Jack was leash aggressive and we had trouble walking him without pulling and barking at any dog that came into his line of vision.  There was some skepticism as to whether virtual training would work for Jack, but we were open to the process once we had aloud consultation with Maribel. We were optimistic once the process was explained. Our assigned trainer was Gina. We couldn’t have asked for a better, more professional, patient and overall pleasant person to teach us how to interact with Jack. By the end of the first session we could see he understood commands. The lessons were an hour long and Jack did well. We did our “homework” every day and Jack was responding well to the process.  By the last session, Jack was doing so well we ended our session a little early. Gina made us feel comfortable and communication was great. Virtual training may have its critics and skeptics, but we are 100% believers in the this method of training. The cost, while pricey, was worth it.

We were desperate for help with our two and half year old dog Ivy. She is one of the sweetest, smartest dogs, but we were having a hard time reigning in her working/herding dog instincts - especially once we brought a new puppy home. I had spent hours looking for dog trainers online, but none of them really seemed to meet our needs. I finally came across Sam Ivy and spent a lot of time researching them, and it felt like they could be the right fit. But it is a big investment, and my husband was very apprehensive. He reluctantly agreed to commit after our first consultation with Enzo... and six weeks later we are both confident that it was worth every penny. Ivy has come SO far in the six weeks since we began training. She is no longer in charge around here - we are! Our home is a much more peaceful place and we have the tools, knowledge, and confidence to be better dog owners for our whole pack. Gina was patient with me and all of my fears, she is so knowledgeable and caring, and she was keenly perceptive to the unique needs of Ivy. Being paired with her was truly an answer to a prayer! I know that the training we've done and the investment we made will have a positive impact in our lives, and our dogs lives, for many years to come!

Team SamIvy,(877) 796-7856,ChIJ6cO5aArrwogRp7Yl0CXsJgE,Micayla Johnson,5,"My husband and I (first time dog owners) rescued Vino, a 6 month old female (half husky with some Staffordshire terrier, Pitbull, & Boston terrier) in May of this year. The only history we knew of was that the police were called to a house and they ended up confiscating 9 puppies and brought them into the shelter. Vino was terrified in the shelter and terrified when we brought her home. She would not leave her crate for the first two weeks, then once we moved her crate in our room she would hide under the bed (shaking) so we couldn't reach her. We decided to get a dog trainer because we weren't sure how to handle the situation. If we had an in person trainer, we knew Vino would not respond well to that because she was still so scared around us, so we looked around online and came across SamIvy. At first, I was a little skeptical of online dog training, but once we had the consultation with Sam, I knew it was the right decision. Right off the bat he answered so many of our questions, gave us recommendations, and reassured us that after the training program, Vino would be a completely different dog - and he was right! Our trainer, Treena, was INCREDIBLE!!!! She knew exactly how to help us train Vino in a way that built trust, yet still set boundaries. She answered all of our many questions and encouraged us, when at times, we felt like Vino's progress was plateauing. She helped us understand the mind of a dog and how best to tackle certain situations so that Vino's scaredness didn't turn into aggression later on. When we would practice commands with Vino, Treena would take the time to ensure we knew how to do the command properly before the end of the session. Treena's expertise, passion, attention to detail, and positive attitude, truly made all the difference in Vino's transformation. I would recommend SamIvy to ANYONE and EVERYONE! It is worth every penny. They have the program and structure down to a science, and as long as you put the time in with your dog, the results are truly unbelievable!!! Thank you SamIvy and thank you Treena!!!

Team SamIvy,(877) 796-7856,ChIJ6cO5aArrwogRp7Yl0CXsJgE,kauser Ahmed,5,"We have been working with Holli as our trainer for our reactive 4 year pittie mix rescue pup, Wesley, for the last few weeks and I am truly amazed at the results she has helped us to achieve. Wesley was always a sweet, loving dog at home but because of his reactivity and sheer strength, he was so stressful and frankly scary for me to walk. I never knew what might startle or trigger him and more than once, I was pulled to the ground as Wes lunged at a jogger or a cat. Because of Holli’s careful, smart and completely doable approach to training exactly these kinds of dogs , and their owners , in a matter of weeks, I have a calm, relaxed dog and I feel so much more confident and safe walking him. As a small woman in her 50s, I was really worried that I couldn’t keep either of us safe outside our house. I can’t express how grateful I am to Holli for showing me this was not our fate forever!

Lastly, we had a gathering at our house of multiple families and small children last weekend. Normally, we would board Wesley because he would just be too excitable and disruptive. We put into practice Holli’s strategies and all of us- including Wesley- were able to enjoy a fun and stress free time together.

Every concern we brought up was dismissed as normal. The staff does not care because they don’t have the time to get to know your child. The staff is rude and makes you feel like you’re bothering them by just being there. It seems like they’re too short staffed to care or clean. The waiting room is disgusting, they have two toys in the whole place and they’re covered in a layer of grime that’s past the point of scrubbing off. The exam rooms have hand and foot prints all over the walls that are always there, they never wipe off the exam tables just pull down the tissue paper like it’s clean. I wish we would have changed offices a long time ago due to the lack of care and compassion. The receptionist refuses to let you talk to the doctor about concerns during a well visit because they want you to pre pay and if you have a concern then she makes you pay for a
Sick visit.  If you have a question about vaccines there’s no education just a lot gas lighting. I was told by the receptionist to find a different office if we weren’t gonna comply and that was all over a question about delaying one vaccine after a reaction! There’s no education, no empathy just a lot of attitude. When I had concerns about his ears Dr.J just said they were normal. They were in fact impacted with wax which we found out after changing pediatricians.  Our other concerns were taken serious at our new pediatrician, we were educated and set up with a game plan.

We left our Dalmatian, Zorro, and our mini Dachshund, Kato, for 6 days and they had the time of their lives. The staff truly made it feel like a vacation for them instead of just boarding. They got two full days of pond time in the artificial pond, splashing, swimming, and playing—it was their absolute favorite part!

Every single day we got photo updates that showed them happy, safe, and having fun, which gave us so much peace of mind while we were away. The team was also quick to answer any questions we had, which made the whole experience stress-free for us as owners.

When we picked them up, they were not only happy and relaxed, but also freshly bathed and sporting the cutest little bandanas. That extra touch really showed how much care and attention Ace puts into every detail.

It’s hard to find a place where you feel 100% confident leaving your pets, but Ace Dog Boarding absolutely earned our trust.

We adopted an extremely sweet, but hyper energetic dog from Peggy Adams a few months ago, and despite our best efforts, it became apparent that we needed some professional help. After a little trial and error with some other trainers, we found Emily, and thank heavens we did. Immediately, you can tell how much love and care she has for animals. With that said, she also exercises the perfect amount of sternness which with our stubborn pup was definitely needed.

Long story short, we had Paisley board and train with Emily for 3 weeks, and she came back a new dog. She went from being borderline uncontrollable on the leash, to walking with no leash. It is really incredible.

The last thing I’ll say about Emily is how available she makes herself… she is always happy to answer questions over the phone or text and go out of her way to make sure she is giving you all the tools you need to be a good owner.

Our kitty got sick, so we ended up taking our pup to daycare every day for a week. The staff were friendly at each drop off and pick up, and even told us that the first 3 visits were free! We had no idea and they could have easily charged us for them. The playrooms are separated based on size and energy level, and they have access to an outside play area as well. There’s space for dogs to be taken out of the play area if they need to eat or just take a break from playing. It is reasonably priced and available all day during the week (shorter hours on the weekend). I especially love the playroom and yard cameras so I can check in on our girl whenever I want to.

Our 4.5 month old pup graduated day camp today and I have nothing but amazing things to say about Bri (and really all of the staff at the Dog Wizard). From evaluation (at 12 weeks old) with Corrie to actual sessions each week and daily follow up with Bri we felt comfortable through the entire process and that every penny was well spent for the value of time and care they put into training the dogs.
Zoe is a completely different dog than she was 6 sessions ago. We sent in a typical stubborn puppy with some bad habits we didn't know we created and came out with a fantastic well behaved baby (that still tests her limits but that's to be expected 😆).
We humans got just about as much training as Zoe did (if not more) so we knew how to handle puppy better but Bri was there every step of the way to tweak what we were doing and answer all of my frantic ""why is she doing...[insert whatever crazy thing Zoe does at home but not at the facility]"" texts!

As owners, it was definitely hard being separated from him, but we quickly learned to trust the process. The entire team at The Dog Wizard is truly dedicated to setting dogs (and their families!) up for success so they can live their best doggy lives. Communication throughout the program was excellent — we especially loved getting photo and video updates, including all the fun field trips to dog-friendly places with his new doggy friends!

The aftercare support has also been outstanding. When Teddy came home, we were given plenty of time, guidance, and tools to keep the progress going. Consistency is key, and it’s so comforting to know we’re not doing it alone. We're really looking forward to joining the weekend graduate social meetups too!

The Gallery at Cape Coral,(239) 376-0417,ChIJcfDjM65H24gRYqlewcttUNI,RCFLYERDAN,5,"I’m thankful for The Gallery and their staff.
I moved my mother who is suffering with Alzheimer’s and Dementia into The Gallery Assisted Living June 2024. This was after she lived with me for ten months. At the time, The Gallery was going through upper management changes for the better. The new Director Stephanie Smith took the reins, hiring a new Director of Nursing, Jen, and other staff where needed. Stephanie has a lot of management experience handling the issues of a Senior Care Facility. She and the current staff are very customer service oriented. Seems more like a hotel, than a senior care facility. For awhile, mom actually thought she was in a hotel.
I went through 10 months of H3ll with mom when she lived with me. I couldn’t get help from her primary and memory care doctors. After mom moved into The Gallery, her different symptoms of her disease manifested themselves.  Stephanie, Jen and Tabitha were there to help mom, which helped me. I was at my ropes end with mom. Because of their experience, they were able to get mom the help she has desperately needed. Currently, mom is advancing with her disease and has moved from Assisted Living to Memory Care Wing.
Right now, I highly recommend The Gallery. Thankful for the care, support and cleanliness of the facility.
I highly recommend considering The Gallery for your loved one.

Jody the activities director is an amazing caring soul that takes the time to understand and attend to the independent needs of each resident.  She keeps a watchful eye and is sure to provide family with first hand knowledge of our loved ones.  My Aunt has been a resident in the Memory Care at The Gallery at Cape Coral for almost five years and loves it!  She recently celebrated her 91st Birthday and team member Julie Carver went out of her way to make the birthday memorable!  She helped us in ordering the cake and even picked it up and took wonderful photos for distant family members to view.  The nurses and caregivers are all very attentive and quick to inform family of any potential issues.  So many people have nightmare experiences with Assisted Living facilities for their loved ones - I feel the current team is attentive and quick to remedy an issues.  I am grateful to Julie!

The Hale Hand Center,(321) 674-5035,ChIJazKd4cIR3ogRvnshA54lTYY,Chrissy Kruppenbach,5,"February 2025 Review: Because I've had physical therapy twice before (Shoulder & Foot), I feel I have something to base my experience on. The location was a bit smaller than what I have experienced in the past. Sitting down at a community table to discuss my therapy & to have my bandage opened & changed among everyone else there was something I had never experienced before. Private health information & wounds were always cared for privately. Of course, the therapy itself was in a large open room similar to the one at Hale Hand Clinic... Karen was very kind and knowledgeable. I was pleased with my therapy & my progress thus far... Can't wait to see her Friday to show her what I can do now!!

MARCH 2025 Review: PAPERWORK... Should be offered to be filled out BEFORE arriving. The first time I went in February, I had left-hand surgery & could still use my right hand to fill out the paperwork... However, less than a month later I had right-hand surgery and could NOT use my right hand to fill out paperwork. Thank goodness there was someone kind enough to fill out the paperwork for me, but if given the ability to fill out the paperwork online before the appointment - it would've been MUCH easier & more comprehensible!

JUNE 2025 Review: I'm done! Both hands are feeling great! I needed some Iontophoresis therapy & that utilizes electrical currents to deliver  corticosteroid through the skin, to reduce inflammation and pain in my hands. Karen would massage both hands (palms), wipe off the lotion with alcohol, inject the Dexamethasone onto a pad (with a built in battery) that was connected to the Iontophoresis machine (using electrical stimulation (electrodes). Ions in the substance use the charge of the electrical current to deliver the medication by repelling each other like magnets.), stick it to my hands, & then put the 2nd electrode pad will be filled with saline & placed on my arm to help conduct that electrical connection, so to speak...

THERAPIST: Karen is Awesome! Sometimes there are double bookings of clients, but don't worry! For instance, when I was on the Iontophoresis machine, there wasn't anything she could do for me, so she was with someone else, but was always Very Close by to help if needed & pay attention...

The practice manager was very rude and dismissive. Each time I tried to ask a question, she interrupted me before I could even finish, which left me with unanswered questions. This is not the level of professionalism or care I would expect from a healthcare office.

She started a little over a year ago at 2 years old with maybe 5 words in her vocabulary. She could barely communicate at all, which caused frustration and major behavioral issues. She has become a new kid after working with Lindsay and Jenn. She can now have conversations! She can identify what she wants and asks for it. She not only improved on her comprehension and language skills, but her behavior and manners have come so far! She has learned to take turns, and express how she feels with words. She no longer has full blown tantrums! Lindsay and Jenn do a great job of communicating with each other and customizing my daughter’s next session. For example, Lindsay will notice in her session that my daughter enjoyed a certain activity or she will hear me mention a toy she likes at home and then all of a sudden Jenn will have it set up at the next session with her. Jenn might note something that’s needs more attention and next time we come in Lindsay will focus on that in her session. I notice these little things and I really appreciate it. I was so happy to find the Language Loft. They give custom one on one help in a very comfortable setting.

The toddler program at The Learning Experience is exceptional. It is designed to foster cognitive, social, emotional, and physical growth for each child. My daughter has shown remarkable progress due to the well-structured and age-appropriate activities. The teachers and staff are dedicated and passionate about nurturing young minds, ensuring that each child receives individual attention and support.

One of the standout features of The Learning Experience is their differentiated playground setup. The outdoor space is not just a place for children to burn off energy; it's a learning environment in itself in which the older and younger children each have their own playgrounds. The toddler equipment is designed to safely promote physical development, creativity, and social interaction for the boys and girls enrolled—providing support for my daughter’s fitness level, confidence, and coordination skills.

Moreover, The Learning Experience takes great care in providing nutritious meals and snacks.

As a mom who has spent most of my infant’s everyday life with her, I had a very difficult time with the thought of daycare. TLE’s willingness to reach out with any questions or updates throughout the day has given me the opportunity to stress a little less, while someone else is caring for my child. I receive constant updates throughout the day, IE: diaper changes, what she had for breakfast, snack, lunch, bottles. I receive photos of my child as well. They also are willing to let you stop in and visit to view your child’s classroom whenever you feel the need (which many daycares want a heads up, and don’t let you go to their room).
I arrived the other day early, and got to watch my child playing and smiling with Ms Jennifer and Ms Sonia and it made my heart smile. My child has also had difficulties with the crib and they have been so willing to work with her. They’ve rocked her during nap time and have started to lay her on a mat to work on the process of the crib.
My daughter comes home every day with a smile on her face and another smile when we arrive in the morning.

The main thing I'm thankful for is to have found a training location that can help with all aspects of training needed to help each dog as I have different goals for each dog.  I've had moments where I struggled with one dog and sent them a private message on Facebook and they were quick to help me till we were able to meet again at our weekly class. They're very easy to talk to and want to see you succeed. I appreciate both Kim and Lewis for their help with training 3 dogs because I can get in my own way and rush things so they help me switch gears to help the dog I'm working. Classes are fun and informative and if you get to go with them on pack walks you'll get to put what you learn in class to work on the real world. Highly recommend!

DON’T GIVE THIS PLACE ANYMORE MONEY! my heart aches to think of all the people that will come through their doors and have to suffer through this program. there are countless other treatment centers in broward county and in south florida, save yourself the headache and go ANYWHERE else.",2025-10-08 10:42:15,in the last week,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVhZf0UxlvedDyWHMBydPcGfyBRLCmhlRm6kYwxeyC3ZOAC5HY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:21:45.762870,,
The Luminous Care,(833) 422-5585,ChIJzd96cY8d2YgRYWCQ9GJcZAU,BB,2,"The 2 star rating in no way reflects my opinion of the message of hope that recovery programs convey. There were several bright spots. Scott and Dan, the 2 primary facilitators, were living, walking examples of hope on a daily basis. In spite of the chaos they endure daily, they were able to demonstrate patience and tolerance consistently day after day. Novak and Rebecca also displayed nothing but tolerance and professionalism on a daily basis. Thank you Wayne and Jaz and the few clients I met that gave me hope. The simple truth is this! The organization is poorly managed. I repeat, the organization IS POORLY MANAGED. Technicians are too few for too many. The female you speak with when you initally inquire will answer your questions dishonestly. Beware of any facility that does not vet the clients prior to admission. The patient to non patient ratio is sadly left wanton. This being magnified by the patient's that are enrolled not for recovery purposes but for free lodging and food. The environment is more akin to a ""homeless encampment"".  28 to 60 year old patient's with grade school life skills, and ALL BELIEVE THE WORLD OWES THEM MORE.  Constant group disruptions and behavior's you would expect at a preschool. Total lack of structure and zero consequences for behavior's that would result in jail or prison in the outside world. Rampant drug and alcohol use in housing, unchecked. Career hardened criminals caught red handed stealing repeatedly are allowed to stay in spite of the crime. I am mentally exhausted after a 33 day stay. That was my experience. I spent time at 2 of the 3 male residences and they are both absolutely FILTHY and infested with cockroaches. I was told that the residences were professionally cleaned every 3 weeks, which is totally untrue. I was also told all 3 male residences were totally remodeled within the last 90 days. Also untrue. I was told by the female ""recruiter"" that they limit the number of occupants in the men's residences to 7. Sadly, another lie. 16 men, 2 bathrooms, appliances that do not work, sinks that do not drain, bunk beds, and disgusting interiors of the transportation vans all were contributing factors to my discomfort. I was also told there are weekly recreation nights. Movies, dinners out, and beach trips . Yep, you guessed it another lie. This is definitely not a luxury rehab.  The facility occupies two suites in a strip mall that appears to have been built in the late seventies or early 80s. DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ON THE WEBSITE as it pertains to the facilities. And definitely do not believe anything the female recruiter tells you. During the day there are approximately 60 to 70 patients crammed into 2 suites of a strip mall and only 2 bathrooms and 2 facilitators.

My strength and stamina have both improved significantly, and Casey makes each workout so much fun that it’s the highlight of my day. I’ve never had another trainer that not only works with me on strength and conditioning, but can also attend to my needs when it comes to therapies like cupping, dry needling, soft tissue work, etc.

Many people dread going to the gym, but I get so excited every day that I get to train with Casey.

He was going to a well established local PT center but we were seeing little progress with traditional therapy. We started working with Dr. Amy and saw so much progress. Each time we seemed to be plateauing our other PT would ask when we would be going back to her. She takes a whole body approach and it makes all the difference. Our son needed oral ties released and she was upfront but compassionate when talking to me about it, exactly what a new mother needs. She worked with us on reaching milestones, overcoming torticollis and pre/post release bodywork. My only wish is that we had started working with her sooner.

After years of massages, the chiropractor and trying many other things, she’s been the most instrumental in helping me heal from trauma of past injuries and overcoming any plateaus in my progress. It’s amazing how much tension we store in our nervous system from stress and trauma, and she’s helped me understand and work through this.

The Neck and Back Pain Institute,(954) 575-4045,ChIJa5VJsU0F2YgRk4asU5rvC84,Olga Copaev,5,"I visited Dr. Bass with my husband because I had been experiencing persistent lower back pain for over a year. My husband also had pain, though in a slightly different area.

Dr. Bass asked me a few questions and then surprised me by suggesting that, in addition to my back pain, I might also have discomfort in my groin area where the leg bends. To my astonishment, he was absolutely right! I had been dealing with that pain for over 20 years, but I had grown so used to it that I barely noticed it anymore. In all these years, no doctor had been able to explain the cause or offer a real solution. No one even considered it—but Dr. Bass identified it right away! I was genuinely shocked.

After performing a few assessments, he showed me that I had a misalignment in my lower back, which was causing one of my legs to rotate outward. This, in turn, contributed to both my lower back pain and the pain in my groin area. It was a complete revelation to me that everything was interconnected! Dr. Bass recommended a course of acupuncture treatment, and of course, I agreed.

My first acupuncture session was a fascinating experience. Tiny needles were placed in key areas, connected to electrical stimulation, and gently heated. It wasn’t painful, but I could feel specific muscles in my back that had been tense for years gradually relaxing throughout the session. After just one treatment, I felt a bit strange at first, but something incredible happened—my back pain disappeared!

For the first time in a long while, I’ve been sleeping on the same mattress (which I thought might have been the problem), wearing the same shoes, and yet—no pain! Before, even after regular massage therapy, my pain would return within a day or two. But this time, I don’t feel it at all!

I will absolutely complete the full course of therapy with Dr. Bass and share my further progress. But so far, he is the first doctor I’ve met in South Florida who truly understands his field inside and out and takes his patients' concerns seriously.

When progress plateaued, they innovated – adjusting strategies weekly based on my feedback and objective metrics. Their persistence mirrored my own.

Beyond physical gains, they restored my agency. Celebrating micro-wins while I rebuild my identity as both healer *and* healing patient.

> What truly distinguishes The Neurohub? As a doctor, I recognize *exceptional* care:
Their mastery of SCI neurorehabilitation exceeded academic benchmarks I’d studied but never personally witnessed.
Their empathy wasn’t protocol – it was genuine.

If you seek OT that merges clinical excellence with profound humanity – **start here**. They didn’t just treat me; they rekindled my belief in medicine’s transformative power.",2025-06-17 17:33:25,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKA1HjiXmRAudWu5EtHE1ogtf2GAbMweP_OsIQrmwYEwuEBSg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:21:48.644238,,

"The Neuro Hub, LLC.",(407) 900-1818,ChIJE3Vrls1z54gROIJbL2RnstE,Joyce Dennison,5,"I heard about The Neuro Hub in the podcast Noggins and Neurons, which is a simply fantastic podcast for stroke survivors.  I suffered a stroke in September of 2018, and I have been in therapy ever since.  Fortunately, I have excellent insurance and I have been able to stick with skilled therapy for longer than most survivors I know.  The stroke destroyed my motor cortex, so I was told that recovery of my shoulder, arm and hand would be very difficult, and that’s been my experience.  When I heard about The Neuro Hub, which works with chronic stroke patients, I was determined to go there for one of their custom intensives.  Finally, in October, I was able to make the trip.  I’m so happy that I did!  When you’ve worked hard for almost five years and still don’t have the use of one hand, it’s quite discouraging.  Planning a trip to The Neuro Hub was a wonderful lift for my spirits.  I’ve done a lot of reading about stroke rehab and brain computer interface (BCI) just makes sense.  I was optimistic that it would be a way to jumpstart my recovery, and indeed it was!  I just got home from three weeks at The Neuro Hub, and not only did I get improved active range of motion while I was there, I had what felt like a lifting of the brain fog that has been with me since the stroke.  Today I had a therapy session with MedRythms, which is a gait training therapy based on neuro music therapy.  My neuro music therapist noticed immediately that my walking was better.  I realized that the BCI had jumpstarted my walking, too.  I cannot say enough about the wonderful team at The Neuro Hub.  If you’re a chronic stroke survivor, or have a chronic stroke survivor in your family or circle of friends, you owe it to yourself to check them out.  The technology is amazing, and the traditional occupational therapy is equally wonderful.  I learned things about my body that I hadn’t known, much of it very encouraging.  I came home with a rigorous home exercise program so I can continue the high repetitions that are needed for rewiring my brain, and I’m happy to say that I’m off to a good start.  If I continue, I’m convinced that I will see more improvement.  Stroke recovery is certainly a marathon and not a sprint, but The Neuro Hub is a wonderful way to get a boost to continue running that marathon.",2023-10-30 17:01:06,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIHYZVBlXGi5gxDrymB64ujSPBwiuLKYkUfw-ZdGb-jFYYVMA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:21:48.644238,,

I was referred to various occupational therapy providers in and out of state but I felt like they wasn’t experience enough or knowledgeable to help my daughter recover.

There are moments in life that redefine everything you thought you knew about love, hope, and faith. For our family, that moment came through a small boy with a big spirit—our sweet three-year-old grandson, Aiden.

For months, we watched Aiden struggle. He wouldn’t eat—only drink milk. Mealtime became heartbreak, and our hearts ached watching this beautiful boy cry, tantrum, and turn away from food. We prayed endlessly, asking God for guidance, for strength, for a miracle.

And God answered.

He sent us to the Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida in Boca Raton. He sent us angels on earth, Ms Cam, Taylor McKenna and Kayla McKenna extraordinary women who not only helped Aiden, but loved him like he was their own. And how could they not? He’s a light, full of life, and it just needed to shine.

From the front staff to the therapists, every person in that office treated Aiden with patience, joy, and unwavering support. They created a space of healing, of hope. They gave him a chance.

Aiden entered an intensive feeding program. It was hard. It was emotional. But through God’s grace and the hands of these dedicated women, he passed with flying colors. Today, my grandson is eating grapes. He’s eating turkey sandwiches, eggs, fish, pretzels—and even a cupcake. A CUPCAKE!

He still loves his bottle of milk, but now he will joining  us at the table. He eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He smiles. He laughs. And he no longer cries at mealtime. It is nothing short of a miracle. This Mother’s Day, I received the greatest gift of all watching my grandson enjoy a meal with us, something we only dreamed of before.

To my son and his girlfriend: thank you for never giving up. Your strength has been incredible.

To the Pediatric Feeding Institute: no review, no rating, no words could ever express what you’ve done for us. You deserve a hundred stars, not just five.

To any parent reading this, wondering if help is possible, yes, it is. The Pediatric Feeding Institute offers more than therapy. They offer love, understanding, and transformation. Don’t lose hope. Miracles still happen. We are living proof.

Thank you, God. Thank you, Ms. Cam, Taylor and all Therapists.Thank you, Kayla. Thank you to every single soul at the Institute. You changed our lives.

The Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida,(561) 571-7557,ChIJvTuu4igd2YgRwkIngwD03iQ,Meghan Lenihan,5,"Our family cannot thank The Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida enough for their unwavering support for the two months our son, Keegan, was in their care.  At the age of 2, shortly after his birthday, Keegan stopped eating altogether for an unknown reason.  For 4 ½ years he would only drink from a baby bottle, which was his sole source of nutrition.  Following an autism diagnosis and several years of therapies that proved unsuccessful, we decided that we needed help from feeding experts.  In opening our search nationwide for a feeding program, we felt very fortunate to find this clinic a few hours from our home.  Andrea and Taylor are absolute angels!  Not only did they tackle helping our son to eat again, but they also worked through the pushback behaviors with such grace.  If Keegan was having a particularly difficult day, they moved heaven and earth to find a place/way to make him comfortable and centered for his therapy.  After 8 weeks of intensive feeding therapy, identifying a retracted tongue, performing exercises to loosen his neck (and tongue) muscles, Keegan can eat pureed food with assistance!  He has also become very enthusiastic about trying solid foods as well!  Andrea and Taylor did not give up on our son and provided us with the necessary tools to continue expanding his feeding journey.  People like Andrea and Taylor only come along once in a lifetime, and we are so very thankful that we were able to meet them and share in their company/expertise.  We would also like to thank Abrielle (OT) for keeping Keegan on track while he was away from his regular therapies.  You were a bright spot in his day!  For anyone who is contemplating reaching out for help, please don’t hesitate to do so.  I promise it will be the best decision you’ve made for you and your loved one.

The Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida,(561) 571-7557,ChIJvTuu4igd2YgRwkIngwD03iQ,Dina G,5,"For over 3.5 years, my son struggled to eat. He had severe sensory challenges that caused him to gag on just about everything, as well as poor oral motor coordination that prevented him for chewing properly. His diet consisted solely of Pediasure, milk, a handful of pantry (junk) foods and some purees that he ate with much difficulty. After years of failed traditional outpatient therapy, his attitude toward food only continued to worsen. The local children’s hospital overseeing his care had no remaining option for him other than a feeding tube.

In my relentless research and pursuit to get my son to eat, I stumbled upon the Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida and decided to get him assessed for their 8-week intensive program, to which he was admitted.

My son graduated from their intensive a few days ago, and I can’t recommend it enough. Taylor and Andrea are absolute pros at everything feeding. They used incredible food chaining methods to help my son build upon the few foods he was willing to eat, and desensitized his overactive gag reflex. They did oral motor exercises and taught him how to chew. They helped modify his extremely negative mealtime behaviours and managed his tantrums kindly and firmly. They also taught me and my husband how to feed our son so we could copy their methods at home. As a bonus, the intensive program included daily OT sessions that gave my son an outlet to release his energy and regulate his sensory system. He adored his OT, Diane ❤️

Today my son eats various types of meats, eggs, cheese, pasta, rice, all kinds of bread and spreads, different snacks, some fruit and is working his way up towards vegetables. Taylor and Andrea accomplished in 8 weeks what could not be done by all kinds of therapists over the course of 3.5 years. They have literally changed my son’s life and that of our entire family. They were the answer to my prayers. And while the work still continues here at home, my son is finally free of Pediasure and on his way to making a sustainable, healthy recovery.

Thank you, Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida. You are forever in our hearts and we will never forget you.",2025-08-17 20:47:29,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLDF56Ag8n69Ic087v8sFH4ct5-e-XypiZvZ15H24VTqSZvbA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:21:51.501780,,
The Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida,(561) 571-7557,ChIJvTuu4igd2YgRwkIngwD03iQ,C B,5,"Our 4-year-old son, Connor, attended the Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida for 6 weeks in May/June 2024. He entered the program eating only a few solids, receiving most of his nutrients through his 4 feeds/day of formula through his g-tube. Andrea, owner & lead therapist, was able to diagnose Connor through a virtual evaluation with oral dysphagia & indicate that he wasn’t jaw grading his food, & immediately I knew this was the right fit for us. In just a few minutes, she was able to get him to do something no one else could get him to do, & 2 weeks later we were in Florida!

Andrea & Taylor are exceptional in every way. Their knowledge, methods, & ability to adapt to each child’s needs are unmatched. They work so hard to ensure every child is successful & do not give up. They use combined approaches that include oral motor, sensory, & behavioral. Their approach was strict & firm but in a soft & positive way. It was the opposite of what I expected from “intensive feeding.” There was a lot of playing & fun while learning about new foods & eventually trying those new foods, & no vomiting, crying, or force feeding. They use an approach no other feeding therapist had ever tried, a technique called food chaining. They start with a food your child is comfortable with, & make small changes to get them to eat new foods. Through this method Connor learned about, tried, & eventually ate so many new foods. Connor averaged 1100-1400 calories/day orally, never lost weight, and hasn’t had a tube feed since day 7 of the program. He began the program weighing 27 lbs, & continued an upward trend finishing at 31 lbs. Over the 6-week program Connor ate 30+ different new foods! As a parent I was thrilled to watch him eat a variety of healthy/protein rich foods. We no longer need to strap Connor to a feeding pump 4 times/day anymore.

Connor loved his therapists & was excited to go to “feeding camp” every day. They took the time to get to know each child, their likes/dislikes, & how they operate. For the little ones, they use a sticker reward system where they get to go to treasure box at end of the day. This was a great motivator for Connor! He was so proud at the end of each day.

His therapists made sure that I was comfortable replicating their methods at home & allowed me to sit in every session to observe & be a part of. They understood the anxiety I felt just trying to get him to eat, and they reduced so much of that & made the entire experience enjoyable. The hardest part is transferring their new-found skills to home, but if you stick to the program, you will be successful. Connor still tests me at home a lot but I am firm & stick to everything they taught me. We have had very few setbacks, but he remains tube free!

Children in the intensive program have 1 occupational therapy session/day in one of their two gyms equipped for climbing, jumping & all other sensory needs! The occupational therapist was incredible, she gave Connor lots of heavy pushing & pulling work which really helped him sit & eat during feeding sessions, and my son loved going to the gym each day. She answered all my questions & gave me lots of ideas for at home self-regulation & tools to use!

The location is perfect, the facility is located near so many shops & restaurants, so many well-maintained playgrounds, splash pads, & trails that are all within 15 minutes of the facility. The beaches are beautiful & a great place to take a break on the weekends! Even though we were there for intensive therapy 5 days a week, we truly enjoyed the location & amenities nearby!

Choosing this program was the best decision we could have made for our son, our lives are forever changed, and we are so grateful for the experience & help we received from Pediatric Feeding Institute of South Florida. Our only regret was not finding them sooner. Andrea & Taylor are so passionate about what they do & it shows in their work. They are the absolute best – the dream team! We HIGHLY recommend this program!

I promptly sent them back the next day over a month passes by I never received any further communication from them so I start calling to inquire on when my son could possibly start the program. The manager told me she would call me back the next day after I called only for two more days to pass with no call from her. I call back again for an update only for her to email me with a fabricated story of how I never sent the documents back in that were requested and that they don't accept Health First insurance mind you my insurance is not health First. Then at the bottom of the email I am told for no apparent reason that they won't allow my son to enroll him now this is unjust and unfair as I have done absolutely nothing to be treated in such an unprofessional way. My son was recently diagnosed with autism and is in need of ABA services to get him where he needs to be and yet I'm not understanding why the staff at this place is so difficult to work with.

What do they do here? Pump you with more “meds”, and attend group therapy and private therapy with student interns….the “ nurse”
was a grouchy LPN who made you feel worse with her attitude, and was always in a hurry to give you your nighttime meds- forced, actually, even if you wanted to take them later to maybe help you sleep, so she could leave early, or go outside to smoke…
Saw cockroaches , termites…. Cheap Walmart linens and towels, very uncomfortable . Very cliquey.
They advertise field trips but only if they have transportation—-our trip to the Dali Museum was canceled because the other Wave facility was using the bus-// so they ordered ice cream instead.
And the cost- then it was on line as 37K a month which they assured me several times that insurance would cover it 100%.

The WAVE of Clearwater,(727) 629-5198,ChIJfU_VdifxwogRdcRAfTP19KY,Erica C,5,"I did residential treatment at The Wave and then stepped down to PHP and IOP. My experience in residential was incredible.

From daily groups to outings to lifelong friendships, The Wave truly had it all. Not every day was good there but every day I could find purpose in being there. I also loved the emotional support dogs some of the therapists had/residents. Some of the outings we went on included a dolphin boat ride and to the aquarium.

The support from the entire staff really helped to create a supportive atmosphere. The techs were simply incredible and always were up to talk about anything— from life problems to your pets! They were always available to us and would drop anything for us if we needed them. The therapists were also always available if you needed a quick check in outside of your scheduled appointment and Raveen would always ensure everyone was alright, even offering her time to us as well. The night nurses were simply incredible too and I have so many fond memories of standing at the nurses station chatting away. They also provide check ins post discharge to ensure you’re still doing okay. Finally, the admissions team works really hard to make your insurance cover the stay and also works hard to create a payment plan for whatever insurance won’t cover, which took off so much stress from me.

The other important aspect of The Wave was the lifelong friendships I created during my stay. Even months after discharge, I still talk to so many of the fellow residents there and we constantly check in and share updates, which is what is really special to me.

Overall, I am so grateful for the time I spent at The Wave. I have never felt so stable in my life and I thank a lot of that to them. They were there when I was drowning and they were there when I was celebrating. The info I learned from the daily groups and the relationships I had with the staff I will not soon forget.

The therapy here is truly the heart of the program, and it’s exceptional. The therapists are skilled, compassionate, and incredibly supportive, which is why I’ve decided to extend my stay.

The tech staff is equally amazing—each and every one of them goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and cared for. The senior management is actively involved, approachable, and always available if needed. They create a welcoming and safe environment where you feel almost at home.

The accommodations are excellent, with private rooms, shared bathrooms, and a very clean facility overall. I highly recommend The Wave for anyone seeking a supportive, therapeutic space to focus on healing and growth.

Mr son has been working with Mrs Katie for about a year and a half now. My son was considered behind on speech according to his teachers. It actually turned out that he didn’t talk to his teachers because he didn’t want to talk to them! Mrs Katie immediately became my son’s friend! He would talk to her! She got down to his level and easily became his friend. She helped the teachers around him so they could make him comfortable talking to them to. My son is excited to go to school on days he knows Mrs Katie will be coming. She’s constantly been on my sons side making him
Comfortable enough to be himself and learn to express himself to others. My son was also having trouble playing with other kids. (Biting) Mrs Katie would be there to help him learn all the appropriate sentences to communicate with other kids in his class. My son got in a lot less trouble after learning the words and sentences he could/should be using instead. We are very thankful Mrs Katie worked with my son and really just wish he had more time with her.",2025-02-20 11:32:23,7 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0RaFS302bp_liKssm87uMiAIkx2ILZyOfwo8mEJiOQ3Xl7l0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:22:11.743542,,

Therapy Care - Port Charlotte,(941) 888-4710,ChIJ7y44ocQBmiARKlrqidT716k,Rachelle Hayes,5,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Therapy Care! Very inviting as soon as you walk thru the door. My son has a speech delay so when he aged out of Early Steps at 3 years old I wasn't sure where to turn. I was referred to Therapy Care in Port Charlotte so I made the call to look into it.

My son was placed on a waiting list and I was told it could be anywhere from a couple months to possibly 6 months wait. To my surprise only after a couple of weeks had passed I received a call that there was an opening for my son and the very next day we went in for his evaluation appointment. The following week I received a call that my son was eligible and we got him on the schedule to come in weekly for 1 hour.

We've been attending Therapy Care for a couple weeks now and we've had nothing but positive experiences! My son had never been away from me or other immediate family members up to that point so I figured I would be sitting in on every session (which they completely allow and welcome it) as he has had some stranger danger feelings in the past. After having only a few visits with his SLP Emily, he now goes running to her as soon as he sees her! I'm completely comfortable sitting in the waiting room so they can have 1 on 1 time.

I can't comment on the progress of my son's speech just yet as he's only just started attending but I have complete faith in the therapists and staff at Therapy Care and I know in time we will see progress. I would absolutely recommend Therapy Care to any parent looking for speech or occupational therapy amongst others that they offer there.",2025-04-24 14:26:04,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWZumacKE8Tyt-_SkihRN6yWc7Ex0xbyKavCnJ85w7eulT8iHvPow=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:22:12.888871,,

TherapyWorks,(904) 348-5511,ChIJgUUn5qm35YgRCD6S0RQTIPM,GoodHilll,1,"I rarely leave negative reviews, but I feel compelled to share my experience with Therapy Works in Jacksonville, Florida, in hopes it may help others make a more informed decision.

During my interactions with this business, I was met with an alarming level of unprofessionalism and rudeness from the owners themselves. As someone seeking support for deeply personal and sensitive issues, I expected to be met with compassion, respect, and understanding. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Instead of feeling heard or supported, I encountered a dismissive and condescending attitude that made me feel judged rather than helped. When I voiced a concern about a scheduling issue and attempted to address it calmly, the response I received was not only defensive but shockingly hostile. Rather than seeking to resolve the matter or show basic courtesy, the owners chose to belittle my concerns and speak to me in a tone that was completely inappropriate for any professional setting—let alone a therapeutic one.

What’s most troubling is that these individuals are at the helm of a mental health practice—an environment that should be built on empathy and trust. Their behavior was not only disappointing but deeply unsettling, and it calls into question the ethical standards of the business as a whole.

I would not recommend Therapy Works to anyone seeking a safe, respectful, and client-centered therapeutic experience. There are many other providers in Jacksonville who treat their clients with the dignity and care they deserve.

My 4 years old with Spectrum needs a help because he starts VPK and we needed her at school with him to manage his hyper activity but she goes almost 3 time within 2 months and she cancels about 8times . She didn’t care about my child needs, she is rude screaming at me and my husband while we talk to her on the phone Touch base with her.

And when we give up from her that she never been consistent, we asked her for the discharge, but she ignore us and she said she’ll never do it and she will let my little boy suffering with no service.
Also, she texted me as a parent has kids who need helps and needs a lot of consistent sessions and she calls me self schyo parents that I need mental health.

Also, she sent that text to the group of our team the Rbt and BCBA and the Speech Therapist.
To give them bad reputation about me because I just ask for consistent sessions to my son. Please don’t deal with this lady because she’ll never help your child and she will never care about them the way should be .
please don’t waste your time with her.
till this moment, she didn’t give me any form to cancel her service ( about a Month since I asked her) so I can move on. I need to get in touch with my Insurance  and I did a complain about her and they open investigation…
please please please don’t take your son to this woman or daughter she has no soul.

She just thought because parents are desperate and needs immediate help so she can manipulate them and acting like she own their souls so independent of her she can help or not help and this is the worst attitude that human being can have to do someone needs a help.

Thrive Therapy of Palm Beach LLC,(321) 549-7414,ChIJTzE-NmHX2IgR2BSRxcKs_8A,Erik Bernstein,1,"I reached out to Thrive Therapy of Palm Beach respectfully, clearly, and with full transparency. I disclosed severe trauma. I explained I wake up every morning with panic attacks. I told them I had done neurofeedback before and that I was ready to begin again—out of pocket, no insurance, no delays.

They accepted the consult. Took my information. Gave no indication that anything was wrong.

Then—the next morning—on a Saturday, I received a text message saying I was being referred elsewhere. Not a call. Not a conversation. Just a one-way reroute with no warning. And the referral? A provider I couldn’t even reach that day.

They knew I was in acute distress. They knew I wake up in panic. And they chose to text me on a Saturday morning—without considering a single thing I actually said.

That’s not trauma-informed care. That’s neglect masked as procedure.

I later asked why. The excuse? Suddenly their neurofeedback machine was broken—something they “discovered” after our consult. That contradicts what was said during the session, where the only delay mentioned was a full schedule for two weeks. So either they withheld key info during the consult, or the story changed after I was transparent.

Either way—it’s unacceptable.

As a professional who’s worked in this field for years, I can say this is one of the most unprofessional, disorganized, and dismissive responses I’ve ever received.

This isn’t a review out of anger. This is documentation.

If you're offering trauma-informed care, then texting a trauma survivor on a Saturday morning with no voice, no support, and no care is a failure. Plain and simple.

This experience has now been indexed permanently.

I feel completely comfortable speaking to her.
Also my psychiatrist has been great too!

I can say it’s not so simple finding a therapist. You have to feel comfortable and be able to build a rapport. Sometimes you just don’t vibe with that person. I’ve had my share of trying to find the right therapist also for my child. ( it wasn’t the right fit)
Since meeting Anna I have been so much more communicative. I really enjoy being able to express my feelings but actually be heard and understood.
Empathy goes a long way.

Thriveworks Counseling & Psychiatry Fort Lauderdale,(754) 219-9481,ChIJCxSNGJED2YgR0_TiHWd7IbY,Cristina Miranda,1,"I am absolutely appalled at my experience with Thriveworks. Due to a change in insurance, I was seeking a new psychiatrist to prescribe my usual medications that I have been taking and have worked wonderfully for me. I was unfortunate enough to have seen Salacia Cunningham. There is one medication that I have been taking for 25 years that she refused to prescribe to me. This is not a controlled or addictive substance and actually quite a common medication. Salacia told me that she didn't feel comfortable prescribing my usual dose of this medication. She wrongfully stated that this is a medication that  is used on patients at state hospitals. I am in the mental health field and that could not be furthest from the truth. Like I said it is quite common. This medication gave me my life back and for 25 years I have not had any issues with any psychiatrists prescribing this for me. I think it's dangerous and irresponsible to tell a patient to stop taking a medication that improved my life for many many years. Even more dangerous is quitting this medication cold turkey or reducing the medication to a very low dose. Now that she did not prescribe it, I may experience symptoms such as dizziness, chills, insomnia, vomiting, anxiety, depression and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS!  This is the most dangerous and irresponsible thing that a healthcare provider can do to someone. If any of these symptoms materialize I will be contacting an attorney.

I feel like jumping into it and just putting a label on what the therapist assumes what the issue right away is not helpful at all. Because a person's character saids alot when they are speaking about thier partner. And the therapist should remain neutral not say he is right or she is right immediately because it makes the person automatically feel like they got the upper hand on proving the partner was right n just creates an uneasy feeling.

Thriveworks Counseling & Psychiatry Jacksonville,(904) 299-0184,ChIJtW7dnLTJ5YgRlbxv9PaJvEE,Jamal Wedderburn,1,"Update [8/21/2025]:
I’m lowering my review of Thriveworks to 1 star. After my initial feedback, I was asked what I expected from my session, only to be told they regretted I was unsatisfied. This came after I had to follow up a second time to get a reply. The response I eventually received was cold, dismissive, and took no accountability.

The question they asked served no purpose other than to restate what they had already said, without any effort to resolve the issue. Don’t waste my time if you don’t intend to make up for a poorly executed program.

I was willing to leave my review at 2 stars, but after wasting more time with unhelpful back-and-forth emails, I feel forced to drop Thriveworks to 1 star. I would strongly advise against using them until they improve their system and provide customers with genuine transparency and accountability.

[Original Review]:
Liz, the nurse practitioner, was polite and professional, but the session felt like a waste of time due to the poor transparency in onboarding. I was told I would be offered pharmaceutical treatment, but the specific options were never explained until after I had scheduled and attended the session. This approach feels misleading, as if the priority is booking a session before disclosing the limited treatment options. Overall, my experience with Thriveworks has been subpar and could benefit from clearer communication upfront.",2025-08-21 12:58:57,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX77_4lS13PxKwM7elJ7NMQLknoSN4AMA8w1kP1V_5dQOGRdcy_dg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:22:22.212983,,

I would never recommend😔, please do not get me wrong Therapist and counselor were fantastic but the management and financial department poorly professional. Please see all the details below:
1st: I contacted my insurance and Thriveworks in a conference call to make sure coverage was provided.
2nd: After confirming coverage and only having a co pay of 15 dollars I receive a bill for selfpay consultation when I was already confirmed to be covered by my insurance.
3rd: Please note my daughter and I are under the same policy and we receive same coverage and hers was 15 dollars but for myself they were charging me the complete consultation, when I saw the charge I contacted the customer services and aparently my insurance information was logged incorrectly.
4th: After talking to customer service they resubmit my bill to insurance and insurance paid. Instead of refunding my money after receiving payment I had to call multiple time to claim reimbursement. I have been calling and was informed I was going to received my US$155.00 between since May 9th, between 7 to14 day.
5th:Today 5/30/25 I called  to follow up because I have not receive my money back and they reportwd me that because is more than 90 days they can't reimburse the money to my card and they need to send me a paper check that takes between 2 to 4 week to be process🤦🏽‍♀️ when I request to speak with a supervisor or manager I was denied because they did not have the time aparently to take my call.
I requested my payment to be expedite  because of the long way and aparently that is not possible.
This was a very poor customer support not even try to compensate all the time waiting for my reimbursement and no even taking the moment to answer my call from supervisor.
I would not recomend this place because whatever you try to resolve in therapy, the financial or manager will screw you up.",2025-05-30 09:39:07,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvxeEDtjOirNaUgPVxHrexZoT6AzfU7fYsAcrBWjztRhG4P_1A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:22:23.333975,,

Original review:
I would leave zero stars. First, they want to charge me $140 after missing an appointment because I had to take my daughter to the ER. At the next meeting, I waited for 15 minutes for the counselor to show up. She no-showed. I immediately sent screen captures of myself in the meeting room waiting, dated and time stamped, to customer support. The next morning, I get an email from my counselor that I missed the session and they're charging ME $140 for missing another meeting?!

They scheduled me an appointment out of Michigan. I call to get them to fix the issue and to schedule a different appointment. I'm supposed to get a call back when their ""issue with the system"" is fixed. I don't get a call back. I call the next day, and the woman on the phone has the nerve to start to get upset with me over where the appointment is scheduled, WHEN SOMEONE FROM HER TEAM SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT. I was distressed setting up my account and wanted the first available therapist. I did not expect them to be in MICHIGAN. When I finally do get an appointment for a therapist, it lasts for ten minutes. I am honest about having suicidal thoughts, and my therapist informs me that I can't do telehealth because of this. it's against their policy. The therapy session was immediately ended, what a joke.

My dog Brock is currently in bootcamp with them but i just have to post a review two weeks in. To start off Brock is 6 years old. They say you cant teach an old dog new trick but this is not the case for his trainers. I am disabled so walking Brock became very hard for me as he would run off and be reactive. He doesn’t do that anymore. Not only Shyann and Summit are training Brock but also training ME. Which is AMAZING. These people know what they are doing. Brock is still learning but i gotta say in two weeks he has been doing so good. I will update this review as time goes and i have a feeling it will only get better.
UPDATE: Brock has graduated his first month and if i could give Shyann and Summit a million stars i would!!!! He is back home with me and such a changed dog for the better.

My daughter was nervous so they took it easy with her and went at her pace. They were cautious to make sure they kept it a good experience for her even if that only meant counting a couple teeth.

He started the high school social skills classes this year and within weeks he was making new friends at school left and right. His confidence grew and grew, his independence soared, and he's learned so many valuable social and conversation skills. Jim's laid back, natural style is very effective in helping kids with social skills deficits in a way that is fun and inclusive. Each class has a general theme, but generally it is the only social skills class I have ever been able to find that works with kids in a natural, ""as it happens"" kind of way. Every other social skills class I have researched was always a set number of sessions with a specific outline. This class is ongoing, pay as you go, come when you can and we love it. The added bonus is that my son is also making friends with all the kids in social skills class. We have gotten together for group outings and now us parents are becoming friends too! We have met some really wonderful people through this group, and it has been so fun and refreshing to get together and discuss with other parents what you've been through, what you've tried, what's worked, what hasn't and generally just be able to finally realize that we are not alone. All the things we thought we were the only ones that were experiencing? All these different trials and turbulations having a kid on the spectrum? Well, finds out we're not alone! In fact, at one event, I nearly spit soda out my nose I was laughing so hard when we realized that we've all been through the same crazy things. My son recently started his first job and we made sure to let Jim and his team know that we understand that they have played a big role in making this happen for him. I wouldn't have believed it if someone would have told me that my son would be working nearly full-time hours this summer in a job he loves, making friends at work, school and social skills class, having the confidence and independence to do all these things - on his own.

I had a child psychiatrist who treated me for years who was retiring and recommended for me to seek new physician. I had an initial visit with Dr. Ashlee Amparan DO. Unfortunately, upon my explanation of my prior trauma and diagnosis,  she immediately told me that my prior psychiatrist's diagnosis made 15 years earlier was wrong (Bipolar disorder) and that it was impossible for me to have bipolar if my manic symptoms did not last more than 7 days. I explained that I have gone through both medication treatment and talk therapies for over 15 years to address my diagnosis that has been proven effective which is why unlike most people I have a support group and have trained myself to note the symptoms before I spiral past a 3 day mark. She said well she just graduated medical school and per her textbook it has to be 7 days. At this point I realized it didn't matter to her what my prior treating physician said or what I said, that she thought I was self diagnosing. I just asked her what can she do to help me currently in my depression and she recommended an anti-seizure medication. I took her prescription called me old doctor who immediately told me to find another psychiatrist and not to take the medication she prescribed.

We met Marlena, my sons speech therapist in January and we’re blessed with 10 months of love and and dedication to his development! At the beginning of our time together my two year old could speak less than a hand full of words, had a small amount of comprehension of phrases and seemed a little disconnected. As any parent would, I prayed for his development, not knowing what I was doing wrong, nor what difficulties he was facing, that I didn’t have the knowledge to tackle. From day one, with the vast knowledge Marlena translated effortlessly to us, my sons development exploded. It has been an emotional rollercoaster to say the least, as we never want anything but the best for our children, and to see it unfold before your eyes, so quickly was overwhelming in the best of ways. As Covid ran aggressively through the US only 3 months after our therapy started, I panicked at the thought of losing any part of what we had already built, and if I can speak as honestly as possible, Marlena fought through the changes beautifully and continued to do her thing, reporting tools as clearly and effectively even though our work continued only through screen time. I plead to any parent with a child either expected to be on the spectrum, or maybe just a few steps behind, call Early Steps, call Total Therapy, ask for Marlena, you won’t be disappointed. My bright eyed 3 year old can now sing more than 20 songs, can identify more than 20 animals along with what sounds they make, counts to 20 on his own, knows his ABCs, is saying 2 and 3 word phrases, responds to his name, will follow direction, it makes me emotional just writing this.

What I found was a deeply compassionate and structured environment that not only supported my recovery, but challenged me to grow in ways I never thought I could.

The staff is incredible many of them are in recovery themselves, so they get it. They met me where I was without judgment, but also didn’t let me stay stuck in old patterns. The clinical team, the group sessions, the one-on-one therapy, and even the everyday accountability they all played a part in reshaping how I saw myself and the world around me.

What really sets Transitions apart is that they don’t just focus on staying sober they teach you how to build a meaningful, fulfilling life in recovery. They helped me reconnect with who I really am, helped me process trauma, build healthier relationships, and most importantly, believe in myself again.

I’ll never be able to fully put into words how grateful I am for this place. Transitions helped me reclaim my life and then some.

My experience with Chelie Byerly was marked by poor communication, hidden billing practices, and abrupt denial of care. Despite having a valid payment method on file and never receiving regular billing statements, my appointment was suddenly cancelled for a minor outstanding balance—without warning or clear policy shown to me in any paperwork. When I questioned these practices and asked for transparency, my emails were labeled ‘abusive’ and ‘hostile,’ even though I never threatened anyone or used inappropriate language. Instead of addressing my concerns or providing documentation, the provider terminated services and threatened me with legal language for sharing my negative experience.

Patients deserve honesty, consistency, and clear billing—not to be punished for asking fair questions about their care.

I am in (dire) need of EMDR therapy and made that known, and this is the only place near me that offers this service and accepts my insurance. My current therapist sent me the names of a couple therapists at this office and said that “texting/email is better than calling.” I emailed Jamie, who responded 3 days later (it was a weekend tho so I understood) and she told me she had availability the first week in July and said I could set something up and feel free to ask questions. So, I emailed her back - with questions - and never heard back. I gave it a couple more days, sent another email and STILL didn’t hear back. I then texted Chelie, after getting the hint that Jamie didn’t want to help me, and again, didn’t hear back for a few days. When she did text me back, she told me Jamie and an intern are the only 2 therapists who offer EMDR. Since Jamie had the most experience, I tried texting her this time, but had the same experience as when I emailed her! It’s so rude, irresponsible and absolutely RIDICULOUS!! I finally gave up on her, and went back to texting Chelie, asking for the contact info for the intern. No reply. I texted her again 24 hrs later. STILL no reply, and now we’re heading into yet another weekend!

I let Jamie know that I have CPTSD and I just recently lost my mother. My current therapist highly recommended that I get EMDR therapy ASAP. Even that info wasn’t enough to get her to help me or at least redirect me to the intern per my request.

It takes A LOT for a suffering person to reach out for help; and most trauma survivors have trust issues. Well, let me tell you, this is doing a number on me. Never in my life have I experienced treatment like this from mental health professionals!! I just would like an appointment with someone who is willing to help me!

*** UPDATE: Chelie responded very quickly to my initial review, and wasn’t just apologetic, she was sympathetic. She offered me an appointment, which I took and I’m so glad I did. I’ve been meeting with Chelie weekly for about a month now (for EMDR) and I’m already blown away. Chelie is compassionate, empathetic, supportive - all of the things a good therapist “should” be. I’m so grateful to have been given this opportunity and so blessed to be under Chelie’s care.

We started with Dr. P. when Cassidy was 14 y.o. BEFORE she had any serious health issues. Cass did have allergies and some arthritis at that time. With daily supplements and regular acupuncture Dr. Patino managed and alleviated her symptoms giving Cassidy an amazing quality of life as she aged. Dr. P gave us exercises to strengthen Cassidy’s legs and taught us how to massage her body to keep her feeling well. As time progressed, so did Cassidy’s medical issues. Dr. Patino treated Cassidy’s incontinence with acupuncture and supplements and we saw immediate results. Dr. Patino is not just a true professional who lets you know when she will arrive at your home for the appointment and follows up to see how your pet is doing, she deeply loves animals and finds great joy in helping/healing them. She has a vast array of traditional and natural veterinary knowledge. Dr. María Patino has been an amazing blessing to Cassidy and our family.

My son was diagnosed Autistic by developmental pediatrician. We were sent for ST and OT. The wait list for speech is absolutely rediculous… didn’t get into ST til over a year later! By then there was no point! The OT Naomi Rochelle Steele bullied my son who wasn’t even 2 yet into sitting at a table to eat. She would huff and puff and get annoyed because he would elope from the table. Her attitude towards me was rude and unprofessional. She never followed his care of plan which was to use a visual timer and weighted ball before eating. I stopped going for all of these reasons. Your staff needs to take classes that involve being around children. Especially children with different disabilities and different needs. And I’ve helped my child more than they have in the few months they worked with him without “playing in his food”!  And the messages were just as rude! Do better! And find better employees!  And find employees that know how to communicate in sign language! At the time he started OT none of them did a single sign with him!

We had taken Abby to a vet because something was wrong with her eye. They started us on drops 4 days later. It was worse. Took her to a different vet And they recommended coming here. When we arrived We were greeted And taken care of in a timely manner. Such a beautiful place Very clean we Had a great feeling immediately.
They took Abby back to see exactly what was wrong sadly, when they came back The doctor informed us because the first vet had not given us antibiotics and an infection had eaten a hole in Abby's eye. She did a great job at explaining everything to us in detail giving us three different options, The estimated price for each. Once we made our decision which was to have the eye removed, She informed us that there was probably other places that would be cheaper And that if we wanted to go That was our decision. I thought this was Great And we so appreciated it. But having said that we decided to stay here and I am so grateful we did because they took such good care of Abby. Juan is who we mainly dealt with He brought Abby out for us to tell her goodbye And was So compassionate and understanding This was devastating to us of course. So to sum everything up We chose to let her stay the night. They would do surgery the following morning. Juan called us later that evening to let us know that She was doing well and that she had gotten anxious being around The other dogs so they moved her to quieter part in the kennel. Her surgery was the next morning He called us to let us know that he was taking her down And then the doctor called after she had come out of Sedation said everything went fantastic And that we could pick her up at 4.
Of course there's more details than all this If I talked about it, there would be pages 😊.

Additionally, I experienced rude staff who made my already bad experience even worse - and if you come through the ER, expect to wait hours upon hours to be serviced. I spent 7 hours there. Also be prepared for incompetent staff to further raise your anxiety levels. While they have full-time faculty, you will likely be interacting with students and residents in training.

Most are not trained teachers, just taught by each other so the club can make $$. I was in classes with one that when she was a student in another class I was in, constantly shamed and got angry with her dogs, then she became a teacher in Basic Obedience! No patience or caring or conversation about an issue you might need help with! She said very rude things about me and my dog on the final day. Just not a person with any dog training or personal interaction sense. They don't seem to know what a real trainer is and I've been going to trainings with my dogs for 33 years. USDOC was by far the worst experience. Their classes are way too big simply taught by members who belong to the club, I'm guessing to get their own dogs titled.

Krista is patient, kind, and deeply knowledgeable—not just about speech therapy, but about how to truly connect with a child on the spectrum.

One of the biggest turning points was when she introduced my son to his AAC device. Thanks to her guidance, he’s now starting to understand how to use it to express himself—and that’s opened a whole new world for him, and for us.

Krista celebrates every small win, and builds trust in a way that few can. My son lit up every time he saw her, and that bond meant everything.

Veterinary Center at Fishhawk,(813) 681-9080,ChIJQ2cJjTkt3YgR_ADzhEOISjo,Dennis Gatto,5,"We are so grateful to have found this amazing vetinary practice. Our neighbor recommended Dr.Noel Berger when our 12 year old lab, Princess Zelda,started having mobility issues. We first scheduled a consult appointment. Dr. Berger spent over an hour with us answering questions and giving us advice. His demeanor was so relaxed. We never felt rushed, he smiled often and made us feel so comfortable.
On April 24th our now 13 year old perfect girl came in for her final appointment. At this time Zelda had not eaten for several days and was no longer mobile. We called to make this heartbreaking appointment and every single person we came into contact showed so much compassion and kindness. We were advised to park at the exit door. My husband advised the front desk that we had arrived and two of the best techs met us with a gurney to transport Zelda down a hallway where we entered a room that was tranquil, a beautiful sitting room. Dr. Katie Thompson came into the room, she was comforting, told us what would be happening and told us we could stay with our Zelda as long as we needed. Saying good bye to your beloved family member is traumatic. Everyone was amazing and I don't have the words to express our appreciation. Dr. Thompson actually came out to our car when we were leaving to give is another hug and kind words.
Again, we are so happy we found you. Dr. Berger words fail me, I hope you know how much it means to us that you showed how much you care and took such great care of Zelda and us.
One more thing, out precious girl had too many visits and was over going to the vet. Here last two visits she refused to go in. Without having to ask a staff member she just came over, gently picked our Zelda up and carried her to the exam room.

I don’t even know where to begin because words will never fully capture what NRT has done for me. Simply put..it saved my life.

After multiple doctor apts, endless labs, and no clear answers, I was deteriorating fast. As a young, healthy 32-year-old, this clearly wasn’t typical. I was battling debilitating symptoms, major histamine reactions, and rashes that felt like my skin was on fire for over a month and starting to lose hope, but I knew something was seriously wrong. Little did I know that was just the “surface level” of my symptoms.

When I was recommended to try NRT, everything changed. Lynn who I swear is a true magician and a gift/angel on this earth immediately identified the root cause. I’ll never forget her words: “Something is attacking your cells…you have post pandemic syndrome”

I had done the research years ago, but never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d become a walking case study and a living testimony for this exact scenario.

I began weekly appointments because my state was so severe. During my journey I also ended up in the ER, but NRT flagged all my symptoms that day which kept me alive. I was given a detox protocol and personalized supplements my body was literally begging for, I went from 10X protection (dangerously close to organ failure) to over 400X protection within weeks and climbing.

For the first time in months, I could breathe. My nervous system calmed, my skin stopped burning, and I felt my body start to fight for me again all thanks to their treatment.

If I could give NRT a million stars, I would. The level of precision and care I experienced was unlike anything else. They didn’t slap a band-aid over my symptoms they found the root cause and designed a healing plan tailored specifically to my body.

I plan to share my story far and wide because I truly believe NRT is light years ahead of anything out there. And Viapure Wellness should be globally ranked. I am living proof that their work saves lives.

Thank you, Lynn and the entire NRT team. I wouldn’t be here today without you!!",2025-07-09 16:20:42,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWNU8QQhmAYRI7gAyrbAPys6F2hforxMco_bDJqUJRyFCrgAbv43A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:23:11.671385,,

Vibrant Health & Wellness,(239) 789-6959,ChIJf7C5P8xH24gRw5jdKAGdpXY,Korry Harper,1,"Based on the following experience, I cannot recommend Dr. Kassandra Francis as a chiropractor. She chose to involve herself in a family custody matter involving a minor patient and offered her opinion on an eye condition, despite not being an eye doctor or medical doctor.  The ophthalmologist who properly diagnosed the child’s condition provided testimony that directly contradicted her opinion.

Dr. Francis wrote a letter to DCF, using her self-diagnosis as the basis for alleging possible abuse. After a thorough investigation, her claims were found to be without merit. During a subsequent court hearing where she alleged abuse, the judge found her testimony unsubstantiated and stated in open court that seeing a 3-year-old patient 48+ times for chiropractic visits was excessive. When questioned, Dr. Kassandra admitted she was a friend of the mother's family

The child’s father has repeatedly requested the medical records, yet Dr. Francis has refused to provide them. These actions created significant stress for the family.

For a center that advertises working with children who have special needs, that care and understanding just wasn’t there.

The staff were neither warm nor welcoming to me or my child. We arrived early for our first visit so I could speak with the teacher, but no one ever came out to greet us or even introduce themselves.

What stood out the most—and not in a good way—was how they handled feedback. At pickup, they discussed everything my child supposedly did “wrong” in front of other kids and staff, which was incredibly uncomfortable and unprofessional. It made my child feel like a problem, not a priority. And despite their advertised services, no therapy or support was provided during the visit.

Viva Pediatric Therapy,(305) 890-9691,ChIJexngtFO32YgRsyFNvjz9004,Geidy Nailed it,5,"My daughter has been receiving therapy with Viva for almost three years now.

She started physical therapy when she was just a few months old with Zoimelys Labrada who helped her reach all her milestones—including taking her first steps. Unfortunately, due to logistics, Zoimelys was no longer able to continue seeing Hope, but the care and progress she provided were incredible.Im still in contact with her and she periodically checks in to see how hope is doing.

Then she  began working with the extraordinary Dr. Cynthia Barrett—and I truly don’t have enough words to express how amazing she is. Dr. Barrett’s knowledge, patience, and genuine passion for helping children have made a world of difference for my daughter. She has played a critical role in helping Hope grow stronger and achieve physical milestones that once felt out of reach.Thanks to Dr. Barrett’s unwavering support and expert guidance, Hope is now climbing, running, kicking, and moving with more confidence every day.Her progress has been nothing short of incredible. Dr. Barrett has this unique ability to motivate and connect with her in such a special way, and because of that, she  absolutely adores her. I am beyond grateful for everything she’s done, and I truly hope that she can continue working with her for many years to come.

She  also been working with Diana for occupational therapy, and she has been absolutely wonderful. Diana has taught her so many important motor skills that have helped with her coordination, independence, and confidence.She truly has the patience of a saint and a special way of engaging children—her approach captures my daughters attention and keeps her motivated to keep trying, even when things are challenging. We’re so grateful for the progress she  has made with her support.

Overall, there simply aren’t enough words to express how deeply grateful I am for the unwavering dedication, compassion, and incredible work this company and their amazing therapists have poured into my daughter’s life. They have not only helped her grow physically stronger but have also lifted her spirit, built her confidence, and brought so much hope into our journey.

Every therapist we’ve had the blessing of working with has shown a level of care and commitment that goes far beyond expectations. They’ve treated my daughter like their own, celebrating her victories—big and small—with genuine joy and encouragement.

If you are looking for a team of therapists who will truly care about your child, believe in their potential, and walk alongside your family with heart and purpose, please don’t hesitate to reach out to them. You will not regret it. They’ve changed our lives, and I know they can do the same for yours.",2025-04-17 05:04:49,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXxfjV3jieuVlQPA2Ac6YdNVpkd5UAHn79Jde_Ve48UbVQ-60E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:23:16.411661,,

I updated my address with WellPack, my prescriber, and everything else. I successfully received prescriptions delivered to the new address. Then, WellPack randomly sent a prescription to my old address.

At first, I called them. The person who answered said they would escalate to someone who could help. I said okay. They said they would call me back. No one ever called back.

Eventually I made my way to the store in-person. They apologized and said they would make it right. They refunded me. They said they had to contact my prescriber to try to get a replacement prescription first. I said okay.

I get a message later that my prescriber has “denied a refill request”. I called my prescriber and they said WellPack just asked for a refill on the medication, and did not own up to their mistake to the provider like they did with me. Obviously this caused confusion, as it’s not always appropriate to refill a medication 2 months later without a follow up appointment.

There aren't 100 dogs running around -- they pride themselves on keeping smaller, controlled play groups so dogs can have more positive experiences. After bringing my dog (Lincoln) there for a week of daycare to get acquainted, he began the intensive 2 week board and train. I could not be happier with the results -- my pup (10 months old) came back home with more confidence, amazing leash etiquette, basic commands down pat and a calmness he hadn't had prior to the program. Trainers Caitlin and Patricia were pros with him -- sending videos on YouTube of his progress every night. The best part about the program is that during the 2 weeks, they have the owner come twice for lessons -- once after week one, and once upon pick-up. This helped build my confidence in training, as well (it was also so nice to be able to see my dog halfway through to see his progress IRL!). Importantly, the program is also $1K cheaper than most similar places. Post-board and train, I bring my dog there 1x a week for daycare and plan to bring him regularly for boarding when I am travelling. I highly, highly recommend West Palm Dog and couldn't say enough good things about all of their staff, ownership and etc. I am excited for their new location to open soon!",2025-04-17 07:57:51,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUbhor-Z_7TbsFM5jxhkr4HWE-Khp2kXN7nkbBgKSpHlBaiZwTUSw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:23:31.480240,,

My boss recommended West Point since she has taken her dog there for training. From the first visit I loved the grounds and Melissa and Juan. We ended up having to leave our baby there for 3 weeks (which I wasn’t sure I would be able to survive but I knew it was best). Marcos the trainer was working with our dog as well and Juan and Melissa and they were amazing! They kept us informed sent us videos and pictures and we were able to visit as often as we liked. We took our baby home Saturday and I can see a HUGE difference in him already.  We truly love the whole staff! They were super professional and treated our dog like one of their own.

Westminster Woods on Julington Creek,(904) 621-2099,ChIJX-nnY4vO5YgRgDKixSKha7c,L T Hanley,5,"Is it perfect here? No.  Am I glad I moved here? Absolutely.

When I started visiting CCRCs Westminster Woods on Julington Creek was one of the ones where I felt most comfortable.  The longer I have been here (5+ years now) the more convinced I am that it was the right choice for me.  There are certainly communities that are “fancier”, but they generally come with larger price tags.  There are communities that are newer but don’t have the location and charm.

When researching Continuing Care Retirement Communities in Florida, as well as several other states, I came to several conclusions, including: (1) Florida has some of the best consumer protections for CCRC residents; (2) Non-profits with a history of good fiscal management were desirable; (3) The associated Skilled Nursing facility should be Medicare 5 star rated.  This community scored “5 stars” for all these criteria.

One thing that impresses me about this community is the number of second-generation residents I have met here.

There are plenty of opportunities for residents to be as active as they want.  For physical activity we have a fitness center and several instructor-led fitness classes every day.  There are also resident managed activities such as pickleball, aqua-volleyball, bocce, putting, etc.  The grounds provide plenty of space to walk (or bike) and there are off-campus retail, restaurants, post-office, banks, etc. within walking distance.  There are also many “official” and many resident-led more sedentary activities.  If you are bored here, you aren’t trying very hard.  I have always been welcomed if I wanted to try out a new activity.  In general, ""Welcoming"" is a great description of this community.

Residents are encouraged to participate in the Residents’ Council and its various sub-committees.  When residents participate their voices are heard.  I can attest to this from personal experience.

Westminster Communities of Florida has about a dozen communities throughout the state of Florida.  A person looking into CCRCs won’t go wrong with any of them.  Some are larger, some are smaller.  Several are more “up-scale”, some are more urban.  For me WWJC is the Goldilocks solution – not too big, not too small; not too urban, not to isolated – but just right.

This is Florida, we are on the water (Julington Creek at the confluence with the St Johns River) so I will leave you with a picture of someone visiting the community.  From past experience I can tell you that he (she?) will be encouraged to move along if he (she?) hangs around in Turtle Lake too long.  He (she?) is not a turtle.  In the mean time he (she?) is a good conversation starter for pedestrians walking across the dam.  One neighbor has suggested we should charge visitors for swimming and sun bathing privileges.",2025-05-22 20:45:33,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIhL7-Y33DNf-3SCuMYawyGHFQhVQQsIFdi434kf5hSlba1jg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:23:32.675955,,

This was Lux's 3rd appointment there in a 3 year span of time.The front office staff was wonderful in orchestrating how to get Lux into an examination room without a lot of unnecessary human or pet contact. Then Dr Seth Schwartz thoroughly cleaned Lux's yeasty ears, and administered the ear medication and vaccine while Mike, who luckily is a big strong man, wrestled and held my muzzled Lux. The new Vet tech, Anjunie, was so helpful and brave from beginning to end, and per my request took my payment to the front desk staff while Lux and I stayed in the examination room so we could avoid contact with other humans or pets. The Vet tech, Randi, was a huge plus because she owns a 150 lb Great Dane with a temperament similar to Lux. Randi kindly took the time to share and offer guidance about our dogs similar behavioral issues, tweaking the dosing for the anti-anxiety meds, etc. That really lowered my stress and anxiety level while I was there! Having to take my big, high strung, fearful Great Dane to the Vet is challenging and stressful.

I’ve always been a country lover and wanted to try riding a horse, but my biggest problem is that I’m deathly afraid of heights. Luckily for me, I found just the right place. It’s not only a place to ride but also where you learn how to properly treat and care for horses while riding safely. I was so nervous for my first lesson, but I’m so glad I didn’t back out. They made it an unforgettable experience by keeping my nerves low and giving me the confidence to get on the horse. The trainers did an amazing job walking me step by step through all the proper techniques and positioning. I not only left with the confidence to ride again, I also left with a new friend.

I have had 2 other GSD that were SCH trained and understood the level of intelligence they possessed. After waiting almost 10 years to get another I had to go through the process of finding the proper training team to provide him. I spent 2 months going and meeting over half a dozen training facilities in the SE US. None met my standard of care and experience I wanted for my boy. Fortunately I knew 2 people that have had their dogs go through Fidel's training, both of which were the most well behaved and happy dogs I have ever met. I met and spoke with Fidel on several occasions and found his level of support and care for animals was beyond measure.  So I decided to send my young, full of energy boy to spend the next 20 weeks with him. And though I was sad and missed him terribly, Fidel communicated regularly and sent pics and tons of videos to help with my transition. Dog was fine, me not so much! LOL. In very little time he was able to undo the many mistakes that I have created and turn my baby boy into the GSD I thought he could be. A bad a** dog that does so much more than I thought was capable. I would see the videos and be like, ""is that my dog?!!"" He can be off leash, in public, at stores or restaurants and I can feel confident in my dog behaving. My GSD dog is simply ""ON POINT""!
He spent all the time necessary with me to understand the system so that I was able to command the dog properly and happy to let me know when I wasn't. Spent a week with us both before giving us the green light.
They really love your dogs! I will be taking my boy ""NIKO"" back to visit Fidel as he was greatly cared for and NIKO misses him too!!!!

When you meet him you will see it obvious it more than just a job. He has a genuine love and strong passion for what he does. He treats all dogs as if they were his own. His training abilities is unlike any other, he is the true dog whisperer. This is why even though I relocated to California I flew to Florida with my pup because Fidel is worth it every penny and I trust no one else with my dogs more than him.
My current 8-month Shepard Rotti named Rocco when I dropped him off was stubborn and suffers from hearing issues. During his training Fidel would call and provide updates along with photos of my pup.  He kept me informed throughout the entire training process. When I dropped off Rocco he was uncontrollable, and I feared for his life if he ever got out because he could not hear me call him. I just picked him up from training and he is the same happy pup I left but now has manners and extremely well trained. I can place him at a sit stay 5 houses down and stand out of his line of site and he doesn’t not move. I can now communicate with him, and I can recall him if he were ever lose without fear anymore. Not only did Fidel train him but he spent 3 days training and educating me on how to communicate with my pup what to do to keep up with his training. He set us up for success and even checked in with me after I left with Rocco multiple times. He adapted his training to accommodate to Rocco’s hearing issues and my pup now responds by reading lips, hand signals, and recall using a whistle.  He is like a new confident pup.  Fidel even went a step further and showed me what I how to integrate my pup with my current two other dogs and be able to walk with all 3 of them (all of which are over 80lbs).  People see me with my three dogs and are so impressed how a women mange’s three large dogs and how well behaved they all are.

The first several years the therapists and administrative staff were wonderful. Appointments were scheduled and were made available so we can combine several together, and our insurance was charged correctly without any issues. This past year 2023 everything changed. The appointments were constantly not available to be combined, and we didn't have a constant schedule. The worst thing though was the office messed up our insurance coding or else even worse as they claim, they did some therapy procedures that weren't covered by insurance without our approval. This resulted in a big bill and no matter how many times we tried to get this resolved it was just denied. Also, they miscalculated the number of appointments we have covered. Even our insurance called and explained our coverage but they still wouldn't understand. The previous years same exact coverage and insurance plan worked just fine. We have sadly stopped going there.

I felt like I was in the home of a friend which is a stark contrast from the sterile-feeling and impersonal vibes of typical doctors' offices. She exuded so much feminine wisdom between her pelvic floor and visceral manipulation work. Since that session, my eyes were open to the mind/body/emotion connection to the pelvic floor. Since I don't live locally, I was able to find other healing modalities, like massage and yoga. I also practiced the emotional and physical healing work that Dr. Kristen suggested. I then saw her again in February 2025 and was so excited to share with her how much I have healed many of the issues I had come to her with a couple of years before. This time I was pregnant and she helped assure me of my mind/pelvic floor connection and showed me how to prep my pelvic floor for a natural childbirth.

We turned to Woof Dogs in Loxahatchee when we added a 9 week old golden retriever puppy to our family.
We wanted to be confident that our 2 year old golden retriever knew all his training commands & manners.
We had the pleasure of consulting with Shay about our concerns.
He then selected Tomas for our 6 weeks of training at our home.
What a great match it was!
Our pup Louie absolutely LOVED Tomas
On training days Louie looked forward to spending his session with Tomas.
Tomas is the BEST & he did indeed confirm for us that our dog knew all his commands but he just needed the proper communication from us. It worked & he listens every time
Tomas was very patient with us humans.
He is kind & soft spoken but still firm.
He really knows dogs & his business.
We’ve invested in our pup & tried a few different trainers……never again
Now we know about Woof Dogs & Tomas

Thanks to Tomas for making it so easy.

Back in December I was seriously concerned that my little, goofy Loki would get in big trouble if he got out of my home because he was sure to bite someone. Then I have Rogue who barked all damn day uncontrollably. They both were extremely impulsive and  had other concerning behaviors that I was just not getting through with by my training. I wanted my dogs to live a free and full life and that means they needed to be trained and obedient. After months of trying on my own, the day came where Loki almost bit a city official. That was it, I needed to get serious training.

Choosing a trainer is a difficult process. There are so many options with various opinions and views, but how do you find one that will be effective. Board and train is not a cheap endeavor and the last thing you want is to waste your money. So I called around, spoke to several potential trainers, and did some research.

Ultimately, I reached out to Lexie at Woof Tang K9 and she immediately made time to meet my dogs. I already knew their issues were serious enough to need board and train. She worked with me on the price and got my dogs in immediately.

After 4 weeks of training, the dogs (who I now call my scholars) returned from boarding school. I have had them home for two weeks now and I can say that EVERY penny I spent was worth it! The incessant barking has more than significantly diminished and I am no longer in fear that Loki will bite someone.

Yes, it is up to me continue their training at home and not allow back into bad habits. When O have questions, I text Lexie and she is always responsive. If i need a home training visit- she is willing. I literally have my dogs safely off leash in my yard and I am 100% confident that when I call they will come. Loki isnt running at the neighbors. Neither of them is ignoring my commands. My dogs are free and they are happy because they are so well trained.

I will forever be grateful to Lexie and her team at Woof Tang for giving me the ability to ensure my dogs have a free and safe life!!",2025-01-31 16:29:30,8 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKc6i7X6-xjbnpmQcc5TPYC3154ReA5kQxq--UlPYJz7ndh5A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:23:53.313502,,

I have to say, enrolling Raelyn at Zoom Room Coral Springs has been one of the best decisions I’ve made. She’s already made tremendous progress in just a handful of classes — all thanks to her favorite trainer, Shay!

Shay is truly amazing. She leads the classes with such kindness and patience, always offering helpful guidance to us ""pawrents"" so we can better communicate with our fur babies. ❤️

I’m so excited to see how far my sweet Raelyn will go! Just recently, she reached a huge milestone — she stayed in place while I walked out to the lobby. Of course, she kept her eyes glued on me the whole time, but she held her position like a champ. That’s a big step for her, and I couldn’t be prouder!

I look forward to the day Raelyn is confidently racing through the agility course — I know she’ll get there with the incredible support and training she’s receiving.

Therefore, we drive nearly twice as long coming/going, as the entire lesson lasts which makes is a little less enticing.

I have learned valuable skills when it comes to riding and also knowledge about horses I don’t think I could have learned anywhere else. Kat is patient, everything is at my own pace and I am never made to do anything I do not feel confident doing until I am ready. Kat is encouraging, caring, and goes out of her way to help students when we need it. My boyfriend will occasionally come out to ride on weekend mornings with me, and even though he doesn’t take lessons, Kat is more than willing to offer him advice to improve his riding.

She cares about her students, and she cares about her horses. The horse I lease is incredibly safe, well trained, and kind. He has a specific personality, like all horses, that Kat recognizes and works to meet his specific needs. I have never once felt like I was unsafe with this horse, whether it was on the ground or while riding.

From the moment we started service dog training, I felt confident that I had found the right place. The star of the experience has been Alex, our trainer. His knowledge, professionalism, and genuine passion for what he does are second to none.

Darcy needed to be trained for specific tasks related to my disability, and Alex approached our sessions with a thoughtful, tailored plan that truly set us up for success. He took the time to understand both my needs and Darcy’s personality, adjusting techniques to suit our pace and goals. The progress we've made has been remarkable—not only in Darcy’s skillset but in her focus, confidence, and connection with me.

Thanks to Alex and the team at Idog Academy, Darcy is now a capable, reliable service dog who helps me navigate daily life with much more independence. I’m deeply grateful for their expertise and support, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for compassionate, effective service dog training.",2025-05-07 14:51:15,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWMR-tmFyU2v78VSP8e2i4tsgmS95qzwIlR3Yj_d-xqTAKywhtf=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:24:02.535247,,
