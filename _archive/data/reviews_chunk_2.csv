Eye Care for Animals - Tampa,(813) 881-9799,ChIJI7hd1f3pwogR5sQy25rr1_s,Tara Vogel,5,"When my husband and I didn’t know how to navigate a brand new, scary diagnosis which caused our girl to lose sight in one eye, we went to Eye Care. To say they have compassion and excellent “bedside manner” is an understatement. Dr Stine and her staff spent so much time helping us through this new world and made sure we understood what we needed to do, and what could potentially come our way. The team went out of their way to make sure our dog sitter had detailed instructions in case something happened when we went away. Dr Stine is upfront and honest and really cares about her canine patients and their human parents.

FAME Speech and Myo,(904) 201-9048,ChIJmTdz1XvQGyERW-1RPiCDBA8,Sarah Hicks,5,"We were referred to Alexa by our pediatric dentist for my son's tongue tie, which he had released at 4 days old but has since reattached somewhat, to the point of causing some oral concerns. We had tried another therapist in the past, but my son was not into it, to the point of dreading sessions; the thought of having a tongue tie release terrified him, so we took a break. We had a discovery call with Alexa, and I was immediately at ease and knew she was the right fit for us. She had a clear, cohesive plan and approach, so we knew exactly what to expect before, during and after a potential release if we worked with her.  She met my son for his evaluation and was fantastic with him. She is fun, nurturing and personable. She empowers and educates her patients, even the young ones, so they are part of the process and understand what they are doing and why.  She helps them set goals and has a system to track progress. My son loves going to therapy and works hard twice a day on his exercises. He knows a release is in our future and is already more accepting of that because of the way Alexa has worked with him.

Been taking my son here since October of last year because we had minimal options. The front desk is rude & will not greet you, looking at you sideways when you speak as if you've offended them.

One of my son's therapist Ms Van is very nice nasty. I thought she was trying to help me by informing me about a center called Karen Seigal for my son. It was a sligh & underhanded insult. My son is not retarded & she kept making other remarks saying he will be in occupational therapy for the rest of his life. Today my son wet his pants, Ms Van had the AUDACITY to say they don't have a changing table. My son is 5""1"", fully potty trained, & does not wear diapers. He just had an accident & is partially nonverbal.

More about the front desk. I was literally minding my own business when the front desk was grouped up with Hispanic parents talking mad trash about me when I walked by. I am sick of this place.

FIRST STEP THERAPY-ORANGE CITY,(321) 972-8326,ChIJBwS6dpMR54gRUFJkLe4yDwE,Mikia W,2,"Honestly, I don't like some of their techniques. I believe before trying some of these techniques they should describe it to the parents and ask permission beforehand. My 1 year old son has Dandy-Walker Variant and a technique was used to get my son to cooperate with sitting up where they allow him to just fall back onto the palm of their hand. I would've preferred to be inquired of this technique BEFORE it was presented. Because I would have not consented to it. When I told my husband  how his therapy went, after he got home from work, he was not pleased at all and said our son is just a baby. They should go easy on him.

His OT didn't feel comfortable using the technique as well. I could tell and I don't blame her. I enjoyed a lot of the therapists there and the front staff is always friendly to us. But I don't think the communication level is where I feel comfortable enough to bring my son back. I will now have to look for therapy elsewhere. But I feel it's too much at times. Because it's all about demanding the child hits that goal instead of taking it slow and knowing some kids have bad days. Maybe just have fun that day connecting with the child instead of all the demands of performing the tasks. I felt it was all performance based and little to no care for building a connection with the child. And trust me that makes all the difference!

On a side note:
One of our older daughters was in therapy when she was younger and it was night and day difference. It was a super fun environment. We were always told what they would do each time with her before they would work with her. And if she wasn't having the best day they would just allow her to play (which helped her bond with her therapist). She made progress in those years of therapy and graduated the program before we all expected her to. That's what I am looking for in a therapy practice.

We travelled there right away for a thorough evaluation (my daughter was 19 months) and they treated us with so much love, kindness, and hospitality.

The changes in my daughter were immediate and drastic. After a couple months of intervention she was a completely different child. I’ve never been more grateful for anything than I am for the people at First Words. Today my daughter is a thriving, happy 4 year old thanks to their help.

I was told by our pediatrician to “wait and see” about concerns I was having about my then 17 month old daughter, even though my gut was telling me something was up with her lack of communication. As a new mother, I was frantic and looking for answers to the million questions swirling in my head.

A friend recommended contacting First Words, so I reached out to them expressing my concerns. What I was met with was timely response, knowledgeable, professional and, most importantly, an extremely supportive staff that helped to get us through the evaluation process.

Was it horribly stressful and difficult to hear that my kiddo had some developmental delays? YOU BET.

Did I have resentment and fear and a slew of other emotions toward the program and clinicians and diagnosticians as we were getting the evaluations and diagnosis we needed to begin early intervention? Abso-FREAKING-lutely.

Did the staff wait patiently and help me get through my grieving process as my daughter received a diagnosis? YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY DID.

I was able to seek out intervention for my sweet girl immediately, and educate myself about social communication development, Autism and related disorders from this research project. When I felt completely helpless and overwhelmed starting out with intervention services their How To Guide for parents gave me the empowerment and confidence I needed to get my kiddo communicating and on a completely different developmental trajectory than she would’ve otherwise been on. The few hours of professional therapy we were granted by the State were definitely not lost on us, and I learned so much from them as well (there are multiple heroes in the story of our journey so far!)

But never once did I feel talked down to, uncomfortable or pressured to participate in the studies because they focus so heavily on what a huge impact early intervention AT HOME with THE PARENTS can achieve.

I will continue to advocate for the importance of early intervention and for empowering other caregivers and parents with the tools to make a lasting impact on children until the end of my days!!

The facility itself was spotless and well-organized, which immediately put us at ease.

Ashley at the front desk was professional and efficient, making the check-in process smooth and stress-free. Our daughter’s physical therapist, Amanda, was outstanding—she was not only knowledgeable and professional but also took the time to explain every step of the process in a way we could easily understand. Most importantly, she made my daughter feel comfortable and safe, which meant the world to me as a Dad.

I am truly thankful for the care and attention my daughter received with FYZICAL. We look forward to continuing our journey with them.

At FYZICAL, it’s all licensed PT’s, all the time. Furthermore, the PTs typically only have 1 to 2 patients at a time so they can give your pain and limitations the attention they deserve!

Kim G is the BEST hands-on PT for those with complex medical issues. Instead of just assigning exercises - she integrates a large range of massage, manipulation, stretching and other techniques and tools to give me maximum relief, and improvement, every appointment.

New referrals are required after a medical procedure, which she had. After several years as a client and at a time we needed them most, got the UPDATED referral went to the store after calling them and then basically, told us sorry go away, we no longer accept your Medcare Advantage PPO insurance.  Why at a time you can't change your Medicare plan would they cast off long-standing clients without notice, just when a disabled individual shows up at their store and needs them most.  The Medicare Advantage PPO plan pays the same as Medicare, same guidelines as other Advantage plans.  You can go there if you wish to pay out of pocket.  Therapists are great, the owner must be looking for the dollars, it is a franchise.  Can not recommend.

Update;  I would be glad to discuss and delte or correct.  Spent the afternoon on phone with UHC, actually started an appeal on the August 5th bill, (even though I did not have to) since that did not cover code 97530, which is reimbursable under medicare and the plan.  I am not sure why store  billing did not appeal. Unless UHC was lying, they said "" The preautorization requirement implemented in September came from Medicare"".  UHC tied our call in with your billing department to try and help.  Billing office said she does not handle that call the office.  No answer, it was the office who told me call billing inthe first palce.   As I said yesterday, when asked, yes I would like to speak with the owner.  Sorry if you didn't get the message before I posted.  UHC has said along with other Advantage plans, they pay the Medicare allowable.  I can't speak for your billing process.  We always check providers at the end of year to ensure they accept our insurance.  This is the first time mid year we were ever told sorry, even though she was a long standing patient.

This was the second PT company I tried.  I can’t express enough how pleased I am with the therapy.  I worked with Alan, and not only was my vestibular issues resolved, the testing showed I was very visually dependent, and a few other issues I was aware of, like a tightness in my neck muscles.

Well, to give an example at the beginning I could barely walk on a foam balance beam without losing my balance.  By the end, I could walk this beam fairly well with goggles blocking my vision (no vision) and moving my head simultaneously.

Also my sister noted (without knowing I was doing PT) my posture improved tremendously.  My neck tightness/pain is gone.

The owner Tara put in a lot of effort in assembling such a superb team. Michelle the receptionist is very knowledge and can guide you through your journey. Don't be afraid to ask her tough questions.
Then there are the two therapists I worked with, both are caring and knowedgeable and will help you in anyway they can. Ed was the first one I saw, he assesed me and started me on my healing journey. I am very grateful to Ed for his ability to determine what my problem was and how to take care of it.
Then I saw Laura, she is very compassionate and a pleasure to work with. She was the one that gave me so much relief from the pain I was having. I was in disbelief at first because I have had that pain for  years.

Faithful Friends Pet Cremation,(813) 788-3065,ChIJxcAyeQ5N3YgRJn2S93WDTmo,Brian McCluskey,5,"We can’t say enough wonderful things about Faithful Friends.  In our desperate time of need, while being new to the area, we found ourselves calling around to find a crematorium for our beloved 20-year-old terrier, McGruff. Out of all the places we contacted, no one came close to showing the level of patience, compassion, and empathy that Faithful Friends did.

From the very first phone call, both Mira and Nicole were incredibly kind and helpful. They walked us through the entire process and made arrangements for a same-day cremation, allowing us to have our sweet boy back with us as soon as possible.

When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by Damon (along with the resident Boss Cat, Tinker, and Baby Boss, Macie Marie) and his kindness and compassion were exactly what we needed in that difficult moment.

We’ve spent our lives rescuing dogs and giving them a second chance at life.  We believe it’s just as important to ensure their passing is handled with the same love, dignity, and respect.  After our experience with Faithful Friends, we wouldn’t consider going anywhere else. They made us feel like family, and now, we consider them part of ours.

You never want to face the loss of a beloved pet, but if and when that time comes, it’s comforting to know there’s a place like Faithful Friends who will treat your furry family member as one of their own.

Thank you, Mira, Nicole, and Damon!  Your care helped us navigate one of the hardest days of our lives, and we will be forever grateful.

He advised her ashes would be ready to pick up by the end of the week. Wednesday morning he called advising she was ready to be picked up. Everyone there went above and beyond our expectations and treated us with warmth and sympathy. Mama's was not just a dog she was family and she was the grandmother of our other dog Brick.

Fat Cat Cafe,(850) 296-9454,ChIJldn3XKtf7IgRyShhvG42x9s,Kasy Pena,5,"** Update we were informed that the people did not work there which is a relief. The owners stepped in after they were made aware of the situation and did what they could to justify the situation. We greatly appreciate the prompt repose on their end. Despite our experience I would like to add that the facility was clean, fun and enriching to the animals and overall a nice environment for both the cats and people alike.
We just went to the fat cat cafe with our 4 year old child who has autism. We paid for a 30 minute session with the cats and left in less than 10. I just cried in my car with my husband. The people there were staring at my kid and she was just trying to have fun and interact with the cats. We wanted to see how she would be with them and one lady who I'm not sure if she worked there or not was especially judgmental suggesting we consider a dog instead because my daughter's high energy. It was a new place and she was excited to see the cats. At home she's pretty chill and is actually noise sensitive. She was also playing with the cat toy and another lady said she's behaving more like a cat than she's engaging with them. Like I try and give my kid a normal day to day. She didn't feel the eyes on her and she didn't under the ablest micro aggressions but man was that a terrible experience. We got treated better at the panhandle pet store when we went to visit the rats. No shade to the front desk lady or purple hair individual at the cat cafe they were nice but need less to say we might just go back and adopt the pet store rats.",2025-07-13 23:48:33,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX2t0dUweZeSBpmqIxzvjGfG3qlcAEEGGi-llkFvCmirFxvzJN9=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:06:59.662486,,

This type of situations are stressful for our babies and for us, so the fact that the personal is so kind and attentive (they even call us the next day to ask about my cat) is really appreciate it.

We had gotten home from an early beach trip. When I let him out of my truck to go potty he was kind of walking funny. I felt his abdomen and it felt like it was puffing up. A couple of minutes go by and it was definitely getting distended. Well, I freaked. Got him back in the truck and just started driving. My vet office recommended Fetch. I called and told them I thought my dog was bloating. They were very kind and told me to be careful getting there. Messi was still wet and sandy from the beach when we got there. The nurses were up front ready and waiting for him. Dr. Pfefferie was the doctor that was the first to examine and take care of him. It turns out Messi had severe pneumonia and the reason his stomach was so distended was because he was swallowing air according to the doctor. Trying to breathe. This doctor was so sweet. Just an amazing person with so much compassion for somebody so young. He was so patient with me. Explained in detail everything that was happening and everything that was going on. I just could not believe how sweet he was. Never made me feel rushed. Understood how upset I was. Messi was admitted to the hospital and put in an oxygen tank / cage. He was there both Monday and Tuesday. The staff could not have been more wonderful. I want to personally thank Jennifer and Mitch who took pictures of him and sent them to me. And Jennifer spending so much time talking to me on the phone and then on his release. They will never know how much that kindness meant to me.

I have been to three emergency vet visits in the last week.  The first one was to a different emergency vet as I live in North Fort Myers, and I looked for the closest one.  One of my male cats, Dylan, was having difficulty urinating so I knew I needed to go to the emergency vet.  When he started struggling again three days later, I didn't want to go back to the same vet so I called our regular vet to see if they could fit him in.  They said it would be best to take him to an emergency vet and recommended Fetch.  I am happy they did!  They were wonderful on that first visit, and they even washed his carrier blanket that he peed on.  Fast forward to Monday and my second male cat, Lenny, was also showing signs of difficulty urinating.  So, I didn't even have to think about it, I brought him to them.  Both of them have Feline Idiopathic Cystitis, which can lead to crystals and blockage, and in male cats is quite dangerous.  They were able to help me get them both on the right treatment plan and we are now moving them to a prescription diet.  Dr. Ritter-Shapiro was the vet I saw on both visits, and she was great!  Both techs were great too, but I do not know their names.  If you ever find yourself in need of an emergency vet, I highly recommend Fetch.

When I first arrived, I was seen right away and given a thorough evaluation by Jon. He immediately put me to work on my road to recovery. The staff is friendly, personable, and always kept me laughing, which made the process so much easier.

I can’t thank them enough for helping me recover so quickly. Jon uses a holistic approach combined with modern techniques, and it truly works.

When we first started with them my son had just been assaulted by an RBT at another office (not any of the Florida autism center offices). When we transition to Florida autism center, they were very patient with him. They understood what he had gone through. They took his actions lightly. But now we are a few weeks in with  him being there everyone at that location has come to know that my son is a free spirit. He will do as asked, he will request to move around. He will walk by your side. It's truly amazing that the men and women in this office have gain the trust of him considering what he has endured. I witnessed an RBT get down to his level as he was having a rough morning. Wrapped his blanket around him and cradled him until he was calm enough to start his day.

He’s made so much progress, and the staff has been absolutely wonderful. Madden has worked with many different team members, and we can honestly say every single one of them has been caring, patient, and skilled.

We receive constant updates, regular reviews of his goals, and collaborative game plans. They work seamlessly with other services, and the management here is truly top-notch. We’ve been super impressed from day one.

As autism parents, we all know the initial fear and apprehension of finding the right support. Rest assured, this place has exceeded our expectations in every way. We’re happy to answer any questions for other parents who may be considering ABA services—because at the end of the day, it’s about what’s best for your child.

Drop off times, his therapists comes out, he'll go grab her by the hand & off he goes NO TEARS. The director just makes you feel like everything is going to be ok & it is.

He's such a picky eater, now he's trying to eat more independently. I pack his lunch and snacks, they can get him to eat at least half of his lunch and snacks. I'm totally ok with that. He gives me a hard time when he's in his mood. They do the best they can in that regard, as long as he snacks I'm good. They're really hands on.

The first time I couldn’t show up to take the exam and they called it a no call no show, however, I told them I could not go due to family emergency. So I had to pay for this  exam.  My dad was in critical condition. I told them everything that was going on and they didn’t care about my dad being in the state of being blind, can’t remember, brain bleed and brain dead. They still had the nerve to talk to me about rescheduling this exam and since I couldn’t reschedule the next week while my dad was in the hospital they fired me. And the same day my dad had passed away. What I’m saying is if you have a family emergency they don’t have a heart like they say. I was crying none stop - they still didn’t care! I waited by the door because of the news of my Father, coworkers had to walk me out after they had fired me. This is Ramiyah Taylor but it’s okay God has greater things for me.

Florida Coast Canine,(813) 924-2784,ChIJ169pN0NJ3YgR5RdVscoMCE0,Ryan Krall,5,"Life changing…that’s the only way to describe Micah’s training. I completed two rounds of 8-week in-home sessions for my 2-year-old rescue Staffy mix, Flynn Rider, who came from a rough past. The improvement has been absolutely incredible.

We worked on everything: basic manners, door dashing, leash walking, recall, nail trimming, muzzle training, reactivity, resource guarding…you name it. As a busy college student, I used to feel nervous just walking Flynn around my apartment complex. Now, I can confidently take him out in public whether it’s a park or a crowded Home Depot.

Micah’s training is top-notch and tailored specifically to your dog’s needs. Not only does he train your dog, but he takes the time to educate you as well. I truly can’t thank him enough for the dedication and care he put into helping me and Flynn.

We sent Nola to training with Micah and when we got her back, it was a total 180. When Nola came home, Micah taught both my fiancé and I how to communicate with her, use the tools, and translate all the training that they did to our own lifestyle and in our own home. Since our initial training with Micah, he has boarded Nola every time we need to go out of town and can’t bring her along.

Florida Pediatric Group,(321) 752-5210,ChIJ_4aalVkO3ogR3SQTq_VtnLg,Wanda Velez,1,"Review for Dr. Enas Iskander: A Disappointing Experience

I had a highly disappointing experience with Dr. Enas Iskander. Her demeanor was incredibly rude, and her medical approach felt outdated. From the moment we stepped into her office, I felt judged and stressed as a parent.

Dr. Iskander asked if my 2-year-old daughter knew how to count to 3 or identify geometric shapes. There are numerous ways to assess developmental milestones, and these questions seemed arbitrary and inappropriate for her age.

What truly shocked me was her recommendation to stop breastfeeding my daughter due to concerns about cavities, despite the fact that my daughter does not have cavities. Our pediatric dentist never mentioned this as an issue. Furthermore, she claimed that breastfeeding was causing my daughter to lack proper nutrition, despite the fact that my daughter eats a well-balanced diet with protein, vegetables, and nutrient-dense foods. Dr. Iskander only asked if my daughter was eating three times a day, without considering the quality of the food.

Additionally, my husband and older son have several food allergies and sensitivities. When I expressed concerns that my daughter might have similar issues and requested an allergy test, Dr. Iskander incorrectly attributed my daughter's diarrhea to breastfeeding. She effectively denied my daughter necessary medical services based on her outdated views on breastfeeding.

Lastly, Dr. Iskander made an uninformed comment about why my daughter does not sleep through the night, adding to my frustration. Overall, I cannot recommend Dr. Iskander due to her lack of professionalism, outdated practices, and judgmental attitude. Parents deserve a pediatrician who is supportive, knowledgeable, and up-to-date with current medical standards.

My doctor cares she provides healthy mechanisms to keep my anxiety at bay. I finally feel  I have control of my LIFE!

The food was consistently delicious, with a variety of options that made me feel well taken care of.

What stood out most was the warm, welcoming nature of the nurses and staff. They were kind, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile.

The physical and occupational therapy team was exceptional. The therapy gym was modern and well-equipped, including computer technology and electronic devices that allowed me to work on different areas of recovery.

After emergency surgery at a trauma center, I was transported to Florida Rehabilitation for intensive rehab.  The hospital was not only a beautiful clean  facility, but the staff was terrific.  I had 1 1/2 hours of Occupational Therapy and 1 1/2 Hours of Physical therapy DAILY, including weekends,  for two whole weeks.  The therapists were excellent, very encouraging and knowledgeable, and got me to be able to bathe and walk (aided by a walker) independently, within 5-6 days of my arrival.  The gym is not only clean but beautiful, with floor-ceiling windows overlooking a lake, and excellent equipment, including electronic and conventional equipment as well as a “fake” car to teach you how to safely get in and out with a broken leg. The staff included two physicians who visited every patient daily, responded to your needs and held weekly multidisciplinary meetings with each patient and their families.  The food was outstanding for a hospital (I was served delicious, moist salmon, at least three times a week.  The dietician also visited the patients to obtain feedback and help with the patient’s nutrition.

It is now 7 weeks since my injury and, with continued PT, I am now able to walk carefully without a walker or a cane.

The staff is very friendly very helpful and try to make sure that you have everything that you need and that you’re safe at all times.

I was there for physical therapy and on the first day you have an evaluation and they are very open to what your goals are. They’re not setting up a bunch of goals that they think are right for you but what it is that you’re having difficulty with and how best to correct that. I had therapy three hours each day Even on the weekends.

The physical therapy department is really up-to-date. They have a lot of the standard equipment, but the most interesting are the interactive programs that project you onto a screen, and then you have to do different activities on the screen to help with whatever skill you’re trying to work on. They also put an app onto your phone if you want where they will upload your exercise routine and it involves a video as well as description of what the exercise that you’re supposed to do and then it will correspond with the therapist and if you have any questions you can ask that through the app. One of the things that I always worry about in a hospital setting is the food and the most outstanding thing is that every meal that I had arrived hot, there is no food getting cold and they’re very flexible about what you want. If you need extra of something they will give it to you and if you have dietary restrictions, which I had quite a few, they were quite happy to meet those and even went out and bought some things that they didn’t have so that I would have those food.

Thanks to all the staff that took the time to take care of me and help my stay not only be very helpful to my condition but also very pleasant in general. One nice thing is also that you don’t have to eat in your room by yourself if you want to eat out in the hallway, they have an area set aside for us to get together and talk and get to know each other and Enjoy our Copy that if",2025-05-01 14:37:56,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLt29Tqd3hwWJKuISAxfYvRR0YKLweu6SbNC5hYeNZVlL5ohg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:07:32.640114,,

To understand my situation is basically this I am coming from another pain management office. I have been suffering for years with pain that I thought was just do to age weight or stress. Yet to find out I have been battling multiple autoimmune diseases on top of my spine problems. My last pain management office was a horrible experience I was treated like I was just a number I was told while midway of my procedure to stop screaming that I will scare his patients away. Besides the area were I was getting that procedure the whole room was full of dust yes dust. I was desperate for relief so I did what I needed to do. Mind you I got 6 epidural shots that day. I did not even go to my followup I just went to this new location. My first visit was with Dr. Kelly where she explained to me about all the stuff that is wrong with me. On top of that she suggested for me to get a Brain MRI to be on the safe side gave me paperwork of what I need to get done. Also, the other pain management doctor I had the procedure I had done was not even needed. Okay so back to what was done today. I had 1 epidural shot today with no pain no screaming no discomfort doctor K spoke to me through the whole process explained everything and was very patient. The assistant with him his name was Lincoln was also a pleasure to be around. I felt heard, understood and cared for. I will never go to any other place at all.

She is incredibly kind, patient, and extremely knowledgeable. I had been going to another therapist for over a month with little progress, but after just one session with Dr. Mora, I finally started to notice real improvement.

What sets Dr. Mora apart is how she customizes each treatment based on your specific symptoms and how you’re feeling that day. She genuinely cares about her patients, and it shows—she has a real passion for what she does and takes great pride in her work. It’s clear that this isn’t just a job for her; she’s committed to helping people heal.

TMJ treatment is definitely a process with its ups and downs, but every time I leave an appointment with Dr. Mora, I feel noticeably better. I could go to another therapist covered by my insurance where I wouldn’t have to pay anything out of pocket—but Dr. Mora’s care is absolutely worth it. The quality and attention she provides makes all the difference.

"Florida Wildlife Hospital, Inc",(321) 254-8843,ChIJqwN0w0EF3ogRlRpi6ZUwJLg,Donna Gamble,5,A young (juvenile) crow got trapped in our chimney and could not fly out and could not get passed the small flu opening either.  Josie and Chris were the volunteers who came and were able to release the restriction on the flu damper to expand the opening so they could successfully access and retrieve the bird. They took the bird to the hospital for evaluation and will be caring for it there until it can survive on its own.  Everyone involved--at the hospital as well as these two volunteers---were remarkably compassionate.

When we picked up our @Bombondoodle, we were thrilled with the results. He looked absolutely adorable, and his coat was perfectly groomed and soft. It's clear that the team at Fluffy Paws takes pride in their work and genuinely cares about the pets they serve.

We also appreciated the clean and well-maintained salon environment. It was evident that hygiene and pet safety are top priorities here.

Fluid Form Studio,(386) 366-1769,ChIJFzsM4qLc5ogRgNSIupkjHmg,Chaya Michel,1,"I used to really enjoy coming to this Pilates studio. The classes were solid, and the space had potential to feel like a welcoming place for regulars. Unfortunately, I stopped going after being told I couldn’t bring my children even though they were old enough to quietly sit by the front door with their iPads. They never disrupted the class or made a sound. It was my one hour to do something for myself, and they were completely respectful of that.

What made it worse was the double standard: the owner regularly brought in her dog, which not only wandered into my space but actually licked me. I’m allergic to dogs. She never asked if anyone was OK with it.

So let me get this straight. kids quietly watching a screen in the corner are an issue, but a dog licking clients is fine? That kind of selective enforcement and lack of empathy made it clear this studio wasn’t the right fit. Moms deserve a space too. And basic respect goes both ways.

Thankfully, I found another studio with more experienced, ones who aren’t still in training for their certifications, and a much more inclusive, professional vibe.

I’ve been locked up I’ve been kicked out of my home I have been hospitalized and shined from my family. I have been in many facilities that I thought was going to work but never did. I couldn’t ever stay sober when I was released from any facility for mor than a few months and I lived at programs for years before. I found footprints beachside recovery online and said I’m gonna try it it was just another rehab when I signed up but when I got there everything changed. Today I am 6 months free and sober thanks to footprints. The difference in this rehab compared to others is once you walk through the door you feel like family you don’t feel like a number everyone is on the same page when it comes to you and everything that goes on with you. Your living quarters are above expectation and the cleanest I’ve ever been in compared to other facilities. The groups are very informational but also taught in a way I could understand and relate with. All the clients were on my level and felt the same. Whatever I needed was supplied for me and even John’s dad comes up and shakes your hand your on a first name bases with every staff member. John’s brother Shane helped me with many face to face talks as did John. At footprints they get involved and they care they want to know what’s going on with you and they want to help. I am now still going to iop after my residency and my 30 days tuned into almost 5 months now with them. If your looking for a place to get your shit together call ask for John and let him and his crew help they did for me what I couldn’t do myself and nobody else could either. Today I’m as sober and happy as I’ve ever been they helped me save my life. It can be done it’s up to you to keep trying.

Forever Vets Animal Hospital at Nocatee,(904) 686-2779,ChIJEzj-FT0x5IgRTUVHdBYXCjg,Kyia Marek,5,"I had a great experience bringing my 4 year old bearded dragon here for the first time for her annual health exam and fecal test for parasites. I previously was bringing my beardie to the St Johns Vet near Target in St Augustine for the first 3 years of her life, but their reptile and exotic veterinarian moved away. I chose to come to Forever Vets Nocatee based on a recommendation from a friend who brought his tortoise here. The facility is very clean and the staff were very friendly. Dr. Shannon Quinn was the reptile and exotic veterinarian who saw us and she was awesome! The only part of our visit I didn't like was that the vet tech took my beardie out of the room to be examined, but I believe that was due to another animal having an emergency so Dr. Quinn wasn't able to come in at our scheduled time. Either way, Dr. Quinn did come back to the room I was in after the exam and she was able to answer my questions and take more information from me about my beardie.

I was also pleasantly surprised how fast the results came back for the fecal test, it was the same day! It took at least a few days to hear back about results at our last vet. I recommend Dr. Quinn and Forever Vets for anyone else with a reptile or exotic pet. It's really nice knowing we have a good quality facility in the area that can handle reptiles and exotics.

Boy was I WRONG about that! After my first visit, I left feeling hopeful, and heard! Gina made me feel so comfortable right from the start. She completely reassured me that what I went through was not the norm, and encouraged me to continue with the process.

We were lucky enough to get Foundations Therapy for his ABA Therapy at home, and they are incredible!!! Below is a thank you letter I wrote to them. From one autism mom to another...use them! This is their passion!
When we started ABA therapy with Wyatt, he was non verbal and screamed constantly. Within just a couple of weeks we could see huge changes in his behavior. Within a couple of months he had mastered the crucial signs to show us what he wanted or needed. Just shortly after that he was speaking. And not too long after that, he was speaking and understanding what he was saying. He is able to listen to commands, and follow through with them (even if doing so in protest 😊).  He is repeating words and really trying to understand their meaning.
The attention to detail your therapists showed with my son truly transformed how we live and communicate with him now. His teachers are so impressed that he already knows his letters! Lily has been the most amazing person to our family, and has encouraged us to learn along side Wyatt so we are able to implement his therapy 24/7. If we had questions she would help us out. If something we had been trying wasn't working, she would collaborate with other therapists to see if they had encountered it before and give us some ideas. She is the reason Wyatt is speaking and learning so fast. She has taught us how to calm him down fast, and shorten his tantrums. She has shown us how to better understand and communicate with our son, and we could not be more grateful. She has given us a life we did not think was going to be possible with our son at this time, and has given us a new hope in his future.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything you have done for our son and our family.

My daughter has been going here for a couple of years and putting in a lot of hours since my insurance covered 100%. Her progress has been minimal. They've had her counting to 10 for the last couple of years when in school she's learning addition and subtraction.
They constantly lose therapists because they pay them peanuts, so there is a huge inconsistency as when she finally warmed up to a therapist then she was gone.
But I tried to stick through it hoping to see improvements, until there was a problem with my insurance.

Ft Lauderdale Health & Rehab,(954) 771-2300,ChIJIfHsWBYC2YgRyxorNr_J2Lg,Chris R,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. It was the biggest disgrace for care I could ever have a nightmare over. I chose this place on the 4.7 star reviews. I wish I researched a little more before sending her here. There are 153 reviews 4-5 months ago and you can tell they are fake.

My Aunt was in the hospital for a PE and was admitted to the hospital for approximately 8 days. I was ecstatic to finally get her in this place and it all ended here. Nikki was super nice and responsive and it literally ended on the day she arrived.

First off, they picked her up from the hospital after midnight and brought her to the facility. I drove all the way to the hospital to find an empty room. I had no idea from this place or the hospital she left. Upon arriving to this place around 11AM, Nikki said she was finishing lunch and would be up shortly (see attached pic). Well, it was 2:30 when I left and she never came up. The reason I left at 2:30, my Aunt Virginia was being transported back to the hospital because she had fallen between late the previous night and when I had arrived.

The scan came back negative and it took me another 7 days to get her back in this dump. Upon coming back, they took no precautions and she fell again, less than 9 hours this time. This time she hit her head and got a hematoma which was her demise, my aunt passed away from it.

We did get her into a much nicer facility that took precautionary measures (ordering bedrails from the physician) and they padded the floors around her. Unfortunately, the damage was done and we had to take her back to hospice after two days where she passed away.

Not one time did Ft Lauderdale Health & Rehab reach out to check how she was doing or apologize. Fortunately for them in Florida, they are protected by law so they can't be sued.

I would think really hard before sending anyone here. The pictures make it look to be a nice facility. It was actually kind of disgusting by my standards. My aunt was on the lowest setting of the bed, which was smart. The huge window was wide open with no shades pulled down. The sun was blaring on her. You're right on Federal and Commercial, a very busy area with terribly tight parking. I didn't see any outdoor area that looked decent, although I never was spoken to by anyone there other than text before admitting her. The floor was sticky. The room wasn't private and her roommate was topless when I walked in the room. Patients seemed to be sprawled all over the place in there.

And once again, do you really think 153 people randomly decided to write reviews 4-5 months ago and very few before and after? I'm not sure this place holds 153 people.  This place is a disaster and a sham! Between the hospital and Ft Lauderdale Health & Rehab, they killed my aunt.  Cause of death is hematoma on the certificate.

Full Potential K9 Inc,(561) 289-1713,ChIJ4c6wYhwd2YgRSOxkDwxTwwk,Isabelle Gainey,5,"Full Potential K9 has been an integral part of us being dog owners. We used them back in 2020 when we adopted our Husky Eli who was SUPER stubborn & hard to manage. Dillon had him for 5 weeks & it was a huge help for our family. We got his basic obedience down & learned how to exercise him properly. Have you ever seen an obedient husky?!?! We still use some of the basic training like place & door holds so he doesn't escape lol.

Now being 5 years later, we adopted an Akita puppy named Pepper. We knew Dillon would be our first call as Akitas can be difficult breeds. Pepper stayed for 5 weeks and is like a different dog. She knows all of her basic commands and grew in confidence, which helped eliminate some of my own stress and concerns for her future.

We're super grateful for Dillon & his team, their dedication to excellence in dog's lives, how well they care for our dogs, and for their transparency along the process.

Dillon truly has a gift with dogs. His passion for bringing out the best in your dog shines through with his work. We enrolled our 2 rescue puppies in the 5 week board and train program at Full Potential K9. They came back home a dream…well trained and obedient while still having their same fun loving personalities. Dillon is kind and so helpful…not only does he train your dog he also works with you and teaches you how to maintain your dogs training. It’s very obvious that Dillon has so much respect and love for dogs. He truly wants your dog to live up to their full potential and ensure they live a happy life in their home.

Funky Dog Improv,(321) 345-6657,ChIJbRjRpvoR3ogRoogioh0zgTY,Ward Dougherty,4,"A nice place for a private event in Melbourne, Fl
According to their website, Funky Dog is “...a nonprofit improv comedy troupe and theater based in Melbourne, FL. As a 501(c)(3) organization.” Their stated mission is to bring improv education, performances, and artistic collaboration to the community. It is located near downtown Melbourne and is pretty easy to find as it is one of the locations that opens onto the north side of Eau Gallie where the road splits right next to the bridge. I consider that there is limited parking. Their website shows a lot that was full when we arrived and I ended up parking on the street. Even though the venue seems to host a wide range of improv performances, from classic short-form games to long-form storytelling and themed nights, I visited for a private event, the Melbourne Independent Film Festival Replay. Aaron, the staff who took care of us was professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to make everything run smoothly. From helping set up the films that we were there to see to selling drinks at the intermission. It is an intimate affair with a stage to the right as you enter with a series of tables and chairs that can be configured as needed for any affair. We were there in full daylight and they had blackout type curtains that did a pretty good job of keeping the sunlight out and the street sounds down.

We had tried a vet close by but he had no giant breed experience and was scared of my biggie who was 6 months old and hiding behind me. Dr Aimee was recommended to me by a mobile vet when the 200 pounder was just a baby because no one wanted to deal with him since he would obviously be big. I was impressed because they weren’t scared of him, didn’t treat him like he was going to eat them, and while he’s not in love with going to the vet- or anywhere for that matter because he’s trifling, this is my forever vet. All of my babies have received excellent care here, and I am old and have had many fur babies and a tarantula over the years, so I have had many vet experiences.

Fur Ever Friends Veterinary Clinic,(727) 288-4900,ChIJC1wNTZP9wogRUKztNqksjXg,Marcy,5,"I first started going to Dr. Aimee back around 2010? She treated my husbands cats briefly. When I adopted my first shelter pup, we quickly learned, in Dr. Aimee's words, he would end up being our own personal money pit. During the long 3.5yrs she helped us make very hard, realistic, and financially possible decisions. She NEVER shammed us, but instead helped us weigh options on what was essential. No one expects to adopt their first puppy to find out it has a world of health issues. She was there from day one guiding us until that last day. I knew that she was straight forward, she doesn't sugarcoat, but her REAL reason, is for the animals. During this decade and half, I have followed her to north Clearwater all the way down US19, and finally to her own clinic further south. Its always been an inconvenience cause all the years, I never lived close. BUT I don't trust anyone else but her. Over the years, she was there when I had to put my husbands cat down. I tried to prolong this cats life because I had lost my husband and the cat was the last of just him. She came to my home for us to say goodbye so he wasn't more stressed. It was sad but the easiest goodbye and peaceful. She was also there when I had to put my 2nd foster failure down. That was one of the hardest. When I officially adopted, we found out shortly after that he had mass cell tumors. Dr. Aimee again helped us weigh all our options. The decisions were EXTREMLY hard! It wasn't a cure but it extended his life longer than expected. The day we knew had come, Dr. Aimee helped my dad carry my dog out of my truck and was there for one of the most difficult times. I now have a what I think might be a 6yr old pup that I've had for about 3yrs now. She is a small dog and has been the biggest stressor of my life with her small dog syndrome. Again, Dr. Aimee listens and helps find solutions! My pup came overweight and too much attention made her obese. Dr. Aimee put her on a diet plan and she went from 22lbs to 15lbs in a year. Yesterday's visit was a win with a clean bill of health! There has been 2 times since Dr. Aimee has been my only vet where I had to see another. The first was at a clinic where they scheduled me wrong and on a day she was off. The other vet tried to tell me what I needed when I was there for was for a urine check with my cat. The second she tried to question what Dr. Aimee was already doing and getting pushy and wanting to charge me for more.... I asked for my cat and wanted to leave. Worst nightmare! The 2nd time, I wasn't there, and I had to have faith cause Dr. Aimee trusted her enough in her clinic. Yesterday, my stomach was in knots and all I was there for was my pups annuals. First question I asked the tech in the room, ""who is the vet today"".... The sigh of relief..... If you've read this whole review, then you would rather eat garbage out of a trash can on the street than let your fur babies suffer. If you feel the same....GO TO DR. AIMEE! You will thank me later! I will travel far and wide for my loves to get the best care! I owe her a lot for all she has done and all her clients end up feeling the same!

From the very first session with Dr. Ira Fiebert, I felt completely at ease and genuinely cared for. As a woman, sometimes it's hard to find a healthcare professional who makes you feel safe, heard, and understood—but Dr. Fiebert went above and beyond in every possible way.

Not only is he incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in treating my condition, but he also took the time to explain everything in a way that made me feel empowered and informed. I never once felt rushed or uncomfortable. Dr. Fiebert created a space where I could ask questions without hesitation and made sure every step of the process was tailored to my needs and comfort level.

What really stood out to me was his attentiveness and empathy. He remembered the little things, checked in on my progress regularly, and truly celebrated the milestones with me—no matter how small. It didn’t feel like I was just another patient; it felt like I was being supported by someone who genuinely cared about my well-being.

GIFMAF Dog Psychology Center,(813) 771-2111,ChIJaQ3MJMywwogR8CE3aTuUy4o,Anna Zykova,5,"I'd like to share my experience with GIFMAF. I gave them my German Shepherd for a month and was very happy with the results! My dog ​​is 1.5 years old and he started going through puberty, pulling the leash and barking at absolutely every dog, and sometimes he just couldn't cope with his emotions outside. This caused me extreme discomfort and constant stress. I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to hold him one day. Having reached my breaking point, I started looking for a trainer. I spoke with a huge number of trainers, but my gut instinct told me to contact this school, and it didn't disappoint. I received training videos every day. Mariana was in touch with me 24/7, answering all my questions and requests. I'm very happy with my communication with her and Manuel. They genuinely try to make you happy and make sure your dog is doing well. When I arrived to pick up my dog, I was very worried and didn't know what to do. My dog ​​was also acting strange because he really missed me and didn't always listen to my commands (I advise you not to rely on first impression). When we arrived home, I went for a walk with my dog ​​and simply didn't recognize him. He was very obedient and responded to all my commands. It's been almost a month since he came home, and our results are continuing. I follow all the trainer's recommendations and continue to train my dog twice a day. Now we have a wonderful time together outside, without stress, and we get a lot of compliments ☺️",2025-10-10 22:35:05,in the last week,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKeAgK-btPRynWsbpfyoToKbGy_XTOc4_Ot0p3oSy2KF9ZZgA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:08:06.234086,,

We have two dogs — Maverick (Pomsky) and Jake (Shiba Inu) — who completed a 17-day board and train, and it was absolutely worth it.

Jake can be stubborn, tends to pull on walks, and gets anxious around children, while Maverick struggles with new environments and meeting new people. The team at GIFMAF worked their magic — the progress they made was incredible! They regularly sent us videos throughout the training, and it was hard to believe how much improvement we saw.

Communication was excellent. They kept us informed about any concerns and made sure we understood how to maintain the training once our dogs came home. When I picked them up, Ludiana patiently went over everything with me. It was a lot to take in at first, but she was so responsive afterward — always ready to help when I needed reminders or reinforcement.

Now, I can walk both my boys calmly around the neighborhood, and even our neighbors have noticed how well-behaved they’ve become. I highly recommend GIFMAF!

Alvaro is extremely professional and his knowledge of body systems is soon apparent in the administration of procedures; always providing feedback in a caring and friendly manner. This helps the patient in describing any pain locations. I have complete trust in Alvaro and am very fortunate to have found such a knowledgeable physician who is so caring. Another factor is the modern facility and relaxing environment. Making appointments is also a seamless and quick process. All this adds up to a great experience. As a side note, and even though my pain is in a concentrated area, I have noticed that I sleep much better. Having dealt with chronic pain for many years has allowed me to fully understand the science of cellular benefits of acupuncture-dry needling procedures.

I should have trusted my gut from the beginning when the guy working the front desk told me I needed to call my insurance and find out how many sessions were covered and call him back... Pretty sure that's his job but he was too busy every day sitting there eating food and just chatting..

Next my therapist.  She was nice but after a couple sessions you could tell she wasn't a great therapist.  Talking to her did nothing, zero helpful guidance and info. I went to most of my scheduled appointments but each one started later and later. She was consistently starting our sessions 10 to 15 minutes after our appointment time but she was definitely quick to stop right at the 15 minute till the hour mark or sooner. . I finally just canceled the rest of my scheduled sessions and never went back. You get the feeling this place is just a bunch of college kids having fun with zero actual investment in who's coming in and their well being.

Either therapist is excellent. Cough up the money for any shoes they recommend. The correct shoes are a game changer.

Then get to work. I have been to 2 other physical therapists in town over the last 10 years who were unable to alleviate my back pain.  After this physical therapy I can bend without experiencing pain. I can climb a ladder. I can bend down and pull weeds. I can wash windows. I can get to the floor and plug in a computer.

When I finished PT, I started their wellness program which is like personal training at a lower cost. You work with an exercise specialist during the visit but you still have the PT overseeing your program.

It is pleasant being around the students from UF getting their degrees who oversee the Wellness Program.

The therapy helped in the short term - I'd never had dry needling before, but came to really appreciate it - and I’ve learned a bunch of exercises and stretches that have helped long-term.

I’ve since been in the wellness program (about 8-10 months), and that has seemingly helped to maintain and gradually even improve where things were at the end of PT. I still get occasional pain and flare ups, largely due to my posture at work, but much less frequent, intense and long-lasting.

The summary is they are a pleasant, professional staff offering reasonably priced health and wellness programs in a relaxing environment.

The more fullsome comments are that I cannot say enough good things about Gainesville Physical Therapy & Wellness. I have found if you put in the time and effort, PT almost always improves your condition. I have completed a course of physical therapy several times in the past at various venues,  but none have been more successful than at Gainesville PT & Wellness.

The front desk and office staff (Kim & Rachel) are efficient and pleasant. They work very hard on your behalf relative to ease of access, scheduling and payment.

The physical therapists and the interns/students are extraordinarily skilled.  The therapists ( David, Audrey, Chris & others) have all demonstrated strong listening skills and the ability to craft a personalized program that addresses your presenting issue(s) and really helps drive you to recovery.

Gainesville PT & Wellness also offers an exceptional wellness program.  It's flexible, innovative and surprisingly affordable. I joined in order to continue to build on the flexibility and strength I developed in my initial therapy sessions, with a view to continuing to improve and reduce future injuries.  The exercise techs I have worked with (Kayla, Keith & McKayla) are supportive,  encouraging and fun. They focus on ensuring that your exercise program is tailored to meet your goals while minimizing pain. One of the benefits of this welless program is the easy collaboration betwern the exercise techs and the medical team if questions arise.

Important to me, is that I almost ALWAYS feel better after my session versus when I arrived.

"Global Speech and Rehab Services, LLC",(786) 623-4053,ChIJAYz0ifGt2YgRkYemSoz0wOY,Kathy Lebrun,5,"As the owner of a preschool dedicated to children on the Autism Spectrum, I wanted to make sure my little students receive the best therapies available. Partnering with Global Speech and Rehab Services was one of the best decision I made. Every single therapist sent to my school was a dedicated professional who put her heart and passion in making a difference for my little students, one day at a time. The owner of the company, Hasina Echoles is nothing but exceptional. She always goes above and beyond to give the best services to each child. She recently fought for one of my non verbal student to get him a device he could use to communicate. She came on her own time to the school to make sure the staff was properly trained on it. He now has it for a little over two weeks and he is already formulating complete sentence with it. My little Stanley finally has a voice thanks to her and her wonderful therapist!
I was so pleased with this company that I started using them for my own son who is also on the Autism Spectrum. My son's speech has improved tremendously in the past year and I know his therapist as a lot to do with it.
I am definitely looking forward to many more years of partnership and will continue to highly recommend Global Speech and Rehab Services to every parent crossing my path.

Told her what my issues were and asked if there was any possibility of us visiting. Told her I just wanted to spend time around horses, smell them, pet them, feed them.
Debra was amazing - she said ""come on down"".
So we went. We were allowed to freely walk around, visit, pet, feed, and bond with the beautiful horses there. The workers told us which were the snugglers and their names.
It was my dream. Due to my health issues, I cannot walk far and my doctors keep telling me I need to get out and exercise. I know that I walked more that day than I have in a long time. And it felt so good.
The ladies told us to come visit whenever we wanted.

I needed to bring back full functionality of my left calf muscles and Achilles tendon which had suffered indirect injury from my back damage.

I was assigned to Barbara for my appointments and we became a good therapist-patient team.

Barbara was very instrumental in guiding me through my ""up and downs"" as I struggled with the notion of my injury.

As days and weeks went on, with her care, encouragement, and physical exercise regime provided to me, a great to total portion of my functionality returned.

As a last visit to the center, I had been given the opportunity to work with the center manager, Kelly Rider PhD, on a one-on-one and this meeting was also extremely challenging.

Golden Gate Equestrian,(352) 283-1025,ChIJZ9SgKVt354gR_N7JkJLlIso,Layla Cazul,5,"I’ve been to many barns in my riding career and I have to say that GGE has to be my top 1. I came to Golden Gate Equestrian as a beginner to hunter/jumper only knowing a few basics, I heard there was a summer riding club for teens and was so excited! I scheduled a meet up and lesson with Alexa via text. She was fast to respond, super kind, and attentive. In my first lesson Alexa wanted to see my riding abilities and matched me with her assistant trainer Madelyn. I first started taking once a week lessons and started advancing fast, I have to say Madelyn has an amazing teaching style giving me analogies, asking me questions, demonstrating things and even giving me examples. The summer riding club was an investment for sure, I soon moved to twice a week lessons and that’s when I really started advancing, I would start perfecting my posting trot, trotting over poles and getting ready to canter by practicing sitting trot. I worked with a variety of different horses which tested my patience, my abilities and dedication. Not only were the lessons the highlight of my week but the barn was a comfortable place to be in. The barn staff are super friendly as well as the other riders. The environment was freeing, accepting and it was easy to spark up conversations with the amazing riders in the barn. I cannot leave my review without saying how beautiful the facility is and how clean it is kept oh and the horses are from another world. Most of the horses are super tall and are kept in top notch conditions as well as the little ponies in the barn and out in the pasture. Overall, Madelyn and Alexa were understanding when I had to cancel, cared for me and my riding career and goals, the horses are beautiful as well as the facility and I will never forget all of the things I’ve learned here! If you are interested in taking your riding to the next level and leasing your first horse or boarding this is the place for you. I won’t complain for pricing as every single penny you pay goes to the care of your horse and it shows.

Not many barns are run as a true business, and yes - that does mean the cost is higher - but it also means the care is too.

The staff here is impeccably detailed 👌 Alexa has management and care on lockdown with the ability to add on every service imaginable (but never required), basically unlimited forage, and a pest and bug control strategy that's hard to find in orlando.

Their top notch care is only accentuated by the phenomenal training by Alexa, Madelyn (the HJ trainers) and my own trainer Katie Freeman.

Mia was very thorough, listened, and wrote down all our questions and concerns.  After a short period, we met Dr. Joyce.  From our previous experiences, we were not expecting such an engaging doctor.  Dr. Joyce is easy to communicate with.

The shots were done so gently that Joey barely flinched, and her ear cropping? Pure perfection—those ears are turning heads everywhere we go!

What sets this clinic apart is the heart behind it. Dr. Adalberto grew up tagging along with his dad, a vet himself, since he was just 12 years old. You can tell he’s living his childhood dream—his passion for animals shines through in every careful stitch and kind word.

My 2 cats are admired here and they have been helping me with my male cats and their urinary issues which can be very stressful. I’m almost out of college and they are reasonably priced and affordable which really helps me get the care for my cats and not worry if I have any concern in needing to take them. They are also conveniently open from 7am-3pm so if I ever need to get the prescription food before work I’m able to make it. Even when I move out of the area, I will definitely keep bringing my cats here.

We cannot thank Dorman Pantfoeder and Good Dogs Training Camp enough for the incredible transformation in our 2.5-year-old English Bulldog, Pork Chop. Before training, Pork Chop was stubborn, anxious, and even aggressive at times—refusing to walk on a leash, barking at everything, and spending more time in his crate than with us. Dorman’s board and train program gave Pork Chop the guidance he desperately needed.

Now, Pork Chop is a completely different dog—he loves sleeping in his bed next to us, walks calmly on a leash, is potty trained, and is more relaxed around people and in new situations. It’s truly a night-and-day difference, and we’re amazed at the progress. No dog is unsaveable, and Dorman proved that with his expertise and dedication. If you’re looking for someone to help your dog turn a corner, look no further than Good Dogs Training Camp!

Benjamin took the time to thoroughly teach our entire family — including our kids — how to properly work with Remy using the commands he’d learned. Remy is now so well-trained and responsive that even my five year old niece can walk him confidently! The level of obedience and control he’s gained in such a short time is nothing short of amazing, and it’s clear Benjamin dedicated a great deal of time and care to his training.

The facility itself is very clean, well-maintained, and welcoming. Remy was actually sad to leave, which speaks volumes about the experience he had there. We’re beyond grateful to both Benjamin and George for the incredible work they’ve done.

They take the time to get to know every child on an individual basis, understanding their unique needs and preferences. This level of care and attention is truly commendable and sets them apart from other organizations.

Moreover, the staff at Great Strides are excellent communicators. They keep us informed every step of the way, updating us on our son's progress and providing valuable insights on how we can better support him at home. Their dedication to not only helping the children but also empowering parents is truly remarkable.

We highly recommend Great Strides to any parent looking for a nurturing and supportive environment for their child. Under the exceptional leadership of Kassi and Sydney, this organization does incredible work that truly makes a difference in the lives of children and families. We are grateful for their dedication and commitment, and we feel blessed to have them as part of our son's journey.

As you can see in one of the photos it was far from that, it was a dark brown like a female parakeet would be when broody, I was very concerned he had either testis cancer or he had way too much seed in his diet. I knew something was wrong, I scheduled an appointment with Westside, although it was 4 weeks out. I held my breath since Westside seems to be the only local vet that would take Charlie in. The doctor weighted Charlie and did an ultrasound on his belly and confirmed nothing was life threating yet, but we did need to change his diet asap! She recommended we get his weight down from 61 grams to 45 grams. She also recommended we switch his diet to Harrison's High Potency Fine temporarily, offer lots of Veggies and to closely monitor his weight loss. So I did half and half Harrison's and Fruit Pellets, added a separate dish for fresh veggies for the day. So far it's been exactly 4 weeks since Charlie had his checkup and he's looking so much better and his weight is down to 46.9 grams!!!",2025-04-06 15:42:44,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLJxBkEFtp2IUyG6uQkq9gKMyBAPXgobAhxhui7jda5vORiUBE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:08:37.031866,,

It was a very intentional set up with the leaders educating us on rucking and the connection with goats while also tying in the deeper meaning of the weight we all carry in our lives.
The ""ruck"" we did around Jupiter Farms was such a great option for those of all abilities (we even did it with our kids strapped on as our ""weight"" the second time) and the goat portion afterwards was so much fun! Don't be intimidated, its very basic and more like stretching than yoga (plus optional). The leader, Kimmy, did a sound bath for us and helped encourage the goats onto the backs of those who wanted them up there!
After the ruck and goat, they opened the farm up to us to explore, cold plunge & snack which allowed us to connect with the group (20-30 people) even more. They also had a little area for kids to color or play with trucks which was so thoughtful!

The morning of the appointment I was having a very difficult time getting my cat in the carrier (a problem I would assume a lot of cat owners have. When I realized I might be a few minutes late I called the number listed in my conformation emails. No answer, left a voicemail. Eventually I finally was able to get my cat in the carrier so I call again to confirm I can still come and not lose my deposit. No answer. I call about 3 or 4 more times and someone finally picks up the phone (with an attitude) I explained my situation and all she said was ""drop off ends at 9"" nothing else. I drove to the clinic and arrived at 9:05. I walk in assuming a possible late fee may be applied but didn't mind paying. I get to the counter and explain to the girl at the desk what I'm there for.

She responds to me with ""yea so the cut off is at nine"" she then walks away presumably to ask if she can take  my cat. She says ""there's going to be a $25 late fee"" I say ok and she leaves for maybe a minute. When she comes back she says she can't take my cat because they ""already started surgery"" and hands me a card to reschedule... Even though I called multiple times before hand and explained the situation and have given them business in the past. I lost my deposit and now  have to wait till availability to get my cat in.

While I was not a fall hazard or critical, I still preferred having their undivided attention to insure I was using proper form as I feared further injury.

"H2 Health- Riverside Jacksonville, FL",(904) 944-4042,ChIJcyfgjd635YgR8UIfsVEGP8w,Flor de Maria Goldston,5,"I was afflicted with intense pain and immobility of  my right shoulder, arm and neck for more than a few months. I couldn’t move my affected arm, neck due to intense pain that made my life miserable.

Finally after seeing an orthopedist and being diagnosed, after imaging tests done, with right frozen shoulder with no need of surgery at this time, my orthopedic physician discussed with me his medical treatment plan to fix the problem. One of the mainly therapies he prescribed me was Physical Therapy (PT). I knew this was pivotal for my recuperation and I was very excited to start. H2Health was the services company I needed to attend for my PT  and I chose the one in Riverside Jacksonville, Florida.

I ended up my PT sessions last week and I feel so grateful to the PT Riverside team.  Started with the front lady, Stacy and therapists, Elizabeth, Jeff, and Walker. They did a good job! Due to their knowledge and experience I was able to keep motivated  and improve the range of motion of my affected areas without pain 80%. Specially I want to thank  and named therapist Walker my hero. He worked very hard with me, so I did it too to get my right shoulder and arm healthy again. We did it. They’re almost healthy.

Walker is an excellent therapist, approachable, professional and compassionate. He is great and very skilled. Demonstrated  and corrected me the given exercises. Detailed, motivated and with a positive attitude. He tailored  an array of exercises for my specific situation that allowed  me  to regain my right arm and neck movements without pain most of the time. Thank you Walker, again!

I appreciate the home exercises that Walker and Liz did for me. I still do them to keep strengthening my right shoulder, neck and arm and further improvement. I feel very pleased with the results.",2025-01-17 17:28:17,8 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVMr-qYY7HSKsIi8d6DEqlfIjQOCw6wXLWD-I4j6MpgxPICQro=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:08:50.628435,,

I was at my wits end with our new puppy when we met Babette. Even after going to training at another place, I still was questioning my decision to get a second dog. Then I hired Babette.

Our puppy heels. Sits. Lays down. Stays. Goes to her bed and her crate. Comes. Understands out and heels and sits when we walk her. None of which would have happened without Babette. She is the best.

Absolutely recommend her. Can’t say enough as to her methods. She trained my daughter and I as much as she did our dog.

Haggerty Dog Training of Florida,(561) 789-5628,ChIJubos7MBYwokRpuNxG27atPs,Paul Kushnir,5,"Our dog Phil is a 4 year old Shihtzu that we had for 3 years. During this time, we noticed he was both dog and people aggressive. We neutered him, changed his food, got him evaluated by a vet and it only slightly helped. He was still a problem.

I ended up doing some research and found Haggerty Dog Training. They listened to my issues, reviewed Phil and recommended the 3 week (Monday through Thursday) on-site course. I was lucky with a Black Friday sale where I get an extra week.

Phil completed 2 weeks, has 2 more to go and we already notice a positive difference. I reinforced what they showed me on how to walk him, train him and have him behave with corrections around other dogs or people. He is actually behaving around other dogs and people normally. Every once in a while he misbehaves, but we quickly use the correction methods and it works.

From a value perspective, the dog camp was significantly cheaper than the quotes of having other trainers come to the home. As long as we use the training methods, it works. What was also very nice was that Haggerty took a Christmas photo of the dog and made it a tree ornament for us. They gave Phil a Christmas gift of treats as well. Plus they offered their customers cookies and cake before Christmas. A very nice touch.

In summary, I would recommend them for anyone looking for dog training. As a family, we were at our last option for Phil due to his aggressiveness and Haggerty Dog Training saved the day. Babette and the team really know what they are doing and actually care about the dogs.",2019-12-28 11:33:54,5 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKkDqr5azxXEUjsCoFHm7nh0lsb8E8cFc2RqbF4LVPUHivZaw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:08:54.079344,,

The veterinarians, techs and staff have all been wonderful and accommodating and they treat my two girls so well. Their prices are reasonable and they don't try to push unnecessary services on us. Look at the pictures from my girl from August 21, 2025 - just so excited to be there. She loved everyone there.

I read through some of the non-five star reviews for context and here are my thoughts --

Most of the negative reviews praise the clinic or the veterinarians, but point out that some of the staff could be more sensitive, especially during emotionally sensitive times for the pet owners.

While I've never had this experience with Haile Plantation Animal Clinic, I have had this experience at multiple other veterinarian offices in Gainesville and I can understand how upsetting and frustrating it can be when you're saying goodbye and the tech is cheerful.

I think it's good advice for all veterinarian offices to make sure their staff are mindful - especially if the owner is stressed, worried, sad or devastated.

It has always been expensive to come here, but we wanted nothing but the best for our four legged family members. Today we said good bye to our beloved Hercules. My family had an appointment for 5:00pm today. My fiancé and I arrived a few minutes early to ask about parking close to an exit so we could carry our sweet boy out to the truck. Laura was very kind, sensitive, and incredibly understanding. Laura told us there was a side exit we could park near the private room we would be in. After waiting for almost 20 minutes past our appointment time Lori came in with paperwork for my mother to sign giving permission and consent for the euthanasia. Dr.Adams came back in with Lori to start Hercules’ catheter and Lori said “he is so excited.” The look of absolute horror on my mother’s tear filled face was mortifying. Dr.Adams finished the procedure without Lori in the room. Moments after Hercules peacefully passed I went to speak to Lori with tears streaming down my face. I told her that she needs to be more careful with her choice of words when speaking to families. To come into a room that she knows a family is saying goodbye in and say that is appalling. I left without saying everything else that my family and I were thinking about her. Lori needs to not have any face to face contact with families until she learns how to communicate like Dr.Adams and Laura.

We also made plaster of Paris animal footprint molds, and they offer even more fun activities like tie-dye shirts, Japanese fish print paintings, and owl pellet dissections.

We had such a fantastic time that we’re already planning to return. Everyone raved about the experience, and that’s no exaggeration—10 out of 10! Emily is an absolute gem. Thank you for creating a core memory these children will never forget. We appreciate you more than words can say!

In fact, we had such a great time that I’m planning to throw my daughter’s birthday party here in September. All the moms jokingly said they want to move to the farm!

We have a newborn baby at home and were having issues with one of our dogs resource guarding and getting aggressive towards the other dog around the baby. In just a few sessions with Carola we were able to completely eliminate this behavior. She taught us how to make sure that the dogs know they are not the “boss” in the house. Now they are overall less anxious dogs and are so much more well behaved. We are so happy that we chose Carola to train our dogs.

Happy Paws US,(754) 801-5855,ChIJRWTNCZ4H2YgRWCVM5x94Tmo,Marissa M,5,"I recently adopted a beautiful Ragdoll named Hanna, now known as Luna, from Happy Paws, and I want to share my experience to help others who may be considering adding to their family.

Not long ago, I lost my beloved Ragdoll of 14 years to cancer. The grief was overwhelming. I knew I could never replace her, but I also knew how healing the love of a Ragdoll can be. Their gentle, affectionate nature makes them such special companions.

While searching online, I came across a kitten listed at Happy Paws. Unfortunately, after reaching out I learned she had already been adopted—but they told me they had another Ragdoll available if I was interested in visiting. I was hesitant at first, Hanna was a little older than I had hoped for, but something told me to go take a look.

From the moment I stepped into Happy Paws, I was genuinely impressed. The facility was spotlessly clean, modern, and filled with a sense of warmth and care. They clearly prioritize the health and happiness of their kittens. I was asked to sanitize my hands and wear shoe coverings before entering—just one of the many signs of their commitment to cleanliness and safety.

Even more impressive was the way the kittens were living. They were free-roaming, not kept in cages, and every single one of them was friendly, social, and clearly well-loved. You can tell so much about how animals are treated by how they behave—and these kittens were thriving.

When I first met Hanna, she was standoffish. She kept her distance, and it was clear she wasn’t interested in interacting. I was told she had been passed over by several families for that very reason. That broke my heart. I stayed for a while and spent time playing with the other kittens, quietly letting Hanna adjust to my presence.

By the end of my visit, something clicked. I saw a softness in her, a potential for connection—and I decided to take a chance.

That chance became one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

From the moment I brought her home, Hanna—now Luna—was a completely different cat. She transformed into the most affectionate, loving companion. She follows me from room to room, constantly seeking kisses, cuddles, and closeness. She sleeps in bed with me every night and wakes me up with purrs and snuggles.

She has brought joy back into my life in a way I didn’t think was possible. I’m so grateful I saw the beauty in her when others didn’t. Knowing that I gave her the life she so clearly deserved—and that she returned that love tenfold—has been incredibly healing for me.

Thank you, Happy Paws, for creating such a nurturing, loving environment for your kittens to grow and thrive. And thank you for introducing me to my sweet Luna. She’s made my heart whole again.

I don’t have pictures of the facility, but I hope you enjoy these photos of Luna enjoying her forever home.",2025-09-18 05:33:23,3 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKTP8HtvlLvAiaHv9NK0MnXxZE_TwXufc4VGbyLTgLl9JErYw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:09:03.901990,,

As my last two cats were rescues that died young, this gave me some more comfort in longevity, although I know nothing is ever guarantee in health, I am hopefully in being more optimistic. The other kitties were so cute I had a hard time taking just one. It’s great they have the ability to socialize.

Aaron breaks everything down step by step in a way that makes sense. We focused on a specific command each session and he would not leave the session until we felt confident.

I don't love the online method for ordering medication.  I'm getting better using that site.  But it's a bit cumbersome and adds extra steps.

The only other piece that bothered me is this: when Pacchi was in for her diagnosis, the vet thought she might have cancer.  It was scary.  We arranged for me to come back after work at 3:30, but when I got there, the vet had left for the day.  She gave me a detailed note explaining Pacchi doesn't have cancer.  But she wasn't available for me to ask specific questions.  I had some trouble reconnecting with her.  When I did, she was very helpful and informative.  In the end, I got just what I needed.  I would like to have known ahead of time that she would be gone when I came back, just so I could prepare.  I was pretty worried about that speculative diagnosis and felt let down.

I still use Los Robles and do recommend it to others.  I also recommend they get clear on how they will make contact with the vet if the appointment is later in the afternoon  or if they have to leave their animal for awhile.

We’ve had many pets pass but my hubby always took care of them. Experiencing my 2 little guys ( Shitzu mix) cross together in our home was very sad but peaceful. Kristen was so compassionate and answered all my questions as we sat together listening to the soft music and holding our little guys. We have an 8 year old lab/hound Reese who absolutely screams getting her nails done; Kristen my hubby and I take a team approach to get it done without lifting her feet which seems to be key; she was traumatized by a mobile groomer. Then there is Harper out 3 year golden that ate a corn on the cob! We went to ER care as it was after hours and vet was able to get it up and X-rays showed clear so we were all cheering. A gut feeling had me take  Harper with me for a Friday afternoon appt with Reese.   Dr. B asked if I wanted to do an X-ray to double check to see if all the corn was gone and I agreed. To our surprise there was still corn showing up so we decided I needed to do surgery the following day at the ER as well as spay given it was late Friday and I needed to regroup. And now we have Cooper, a male golden foster I’ve now had 4 months who started at 122lbs now down to 105! Cooper has an amazing story of rescue and the support I’ve received from HHFP has been incredible along with emotional support for me. Cooper  had labs early on  and determined thyroid meds would be beneficial.  Cooper goes into the office for weekly weight checks and recently Dani did an amazing nail trim with no issues, she is such a calming force. Dr. B, Dani, Sarah and staff are outstanding! Personable, engaged, knowledgeable, passionate and extremely compassionate with every situation I have encountered with our 5. Each dog is unique in their needs and each one has been treated with love and individualized care. Visits usually start with Dr. B on the floor speaking to our fur babies engaging and earning their trust with lots of love. I can’t say enough about the amazing team Healing Hands for Pets is and our wonderful experiences over the last 4 years. The care, love and genuine approach Dr. B, Dani and Sarah provide is a gift and blessing each of our fur babies receives at our visits. Absolutely the best!",2024-08-26 17:45:41,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJzxfBG2LOigCPf225YGZDspluwU2xznRGIRamlXscoJo39xg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:09:12.390609,,
Healing Hands for Pets,(727) 687-8435,ChIJ_cNofc7vwogRtp00M3IFXvM,Nicole Davis,5,"I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the incredible care my dog received at Healing Hands. I can honestly say that this veterinary office is unlike any other I’ve ever been to. The level of care and attention they provide is unparalleled.

I genuinely believe that their compassionate approach extended my dog's life by at least six months. I have no doubt that if I had gone to any other vet, they would have suggested putting my dog down long before her time.

My dog benefited immensely from weekly acupuncture and laser therapy. The difference in her activity level after each session was noticeable. These sessions were not only beneficial for her but also for me, because I was in front of a vet every week. For anyone with a senior dog, you know how many questions you have day to day.  This kind of support is invaluable.

I don’t mean to be blunt, but if you’re not taking your pet to Healing Hands, you’re not doing what’s truly in the best interest of your dog or cat. The level of comfort and care they provided to both my dog and me is something I can never fully repay.

Health Rehab,(954) 255-1515,ChIJETillD8F2YgRsE5BW10BcxQ,Jennifer Serna,5,"My mother was referred to this practice by her orthopedic specialist but the process of scheduling needs improvement

I called and spoke with Amanda who stated that In order to book an appt I would have to provide the order/referral

She advised me she would reach out to me once she received the email. She never did till this day. I am waiting. It’s been a week.

The next day, regardless, I called because I wanted to get things going for my 82-year-old mother

I spoke to someone else who took my information and didn’t say I needed to send that information ahead of time so it threw me what was the purpose of me sending it if it wasn’t even gonna matter in the end when all I had to do was take it with me the day of the appointment

Make me feel like I was getting the run around.

I specified to the young lady taking the appointment that I needed someone who spoke Spanish because my mother would not understand otherwise since she is extremely hard of hearing in Spanish is her primary language. I was advised that yes, they speak Spanish there and the person she had an appointment with in fact spoke Spanish. I just called again today to see if I could move the appointment and they just clarified to me that they do not speak Spanish so just a lot of misinformation and then just seems so unprofessional

So unfortunately, I can’t even get past the making an appointment stage because the people that answer the phones really don’t seem to provide the correct information or even care that you are running through loops just to make the process easier on everyone

I canceled my appointment. They could’ve cared less. They’re like OK bye. I will be advising my doctors office that they should probably think twice before referring people to an office that doesn’t seem to care I could be wrong but first impressions really make an impact.

Not sure if I got people in training if that was why I had this situation compared to everyone else’s experience, but it’s just very disappointing if it were in regards to my own personal situation, I would just shrug it off and move on but when it’s a loved one on the line and all you’re trying to do is make sure you’re helping them and their health journey. It’s a bit more frustrating to have to deal with situations like these

Revision: 7.11.2025 2:58pm

I had the pleasure of speaking g with the Owner and talk about feeling heard and understood.  It took my surprise because never have I had this experience and it seriously says a lot about how much empathy and willingness to listen with the intention of understanding the owner has.  To see his heart for helping others is very apparent in the way he expresses his desire to help people on their journey.  I am happy to report I will be approaching going forward with an open mind and believing for the best for my mother‘s care.

It was a great reminder for me today in humility and kindness and understanding and always listening with intent to understand.",2025-07-11 14:58:56,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX5c0BL6hyQ_F-H9G_HqPiL8cVOqyaPOeZB7r7j4Nff36_7YoqY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:09:15.851810,,

HealthPRO Pediatrics Lakeland,(863) 683-4726,ChIJB__ATN443YgRzWYAn-SNE3A,Sara Gamayo,1,I have been taking my grand-baby here for several months now and the experience overall has been horrible. The front desk are not welcoming at all. They have a sign in sheet that has no purpose whatsoever. Several times I have taken my grandson to be told that his therapy session was canceled and no call at all or they have called an absent father that we have told them several times to delete that contact. Our First speech therapist was Eddie which was always late and would not give my grandson his full 30 minutes. He would call him in 7 minutes late and taken out five minutes early. Had an encounter where he had his wife and children in his room and the front desk girl had to tell him to call us in. Changed therapist to Alondra started out great and then the same encounters of bringing him in 5 to 7 minutes late. Several times my daughter had to complain and it changed. Today was the worst because not only Joselyn the front desk girl is rude and very disrespectful as she speaks to you without looking at you. Grand baby was sleep and I asked if it can be rescheduled and her attitude and no eye contact to tell me it was the end of the month and cannot be rescheduled. I told her today she was very rude and disrespectful in speaking to her screen and yet she apologizes looking at her screen. I told her that I will let my daughter reach out to them and left. Daughter reached out to the Director named Sharon which she is also one of his therapist and have no complaint with her and his therapy but as a Director she was also a waste of our time she did not seem interested nor apologetic. No answer as to why she wasn’t able to give him therapy today and was being replaced with Alondra. There  are other parents there that feel the same way but don’t say anything because honestly the waiting list to get any therapy for our children is over a year long. Please be aware of this office.

The referral was not expired when I booked the appointment and they expired after 60 days, when I say it’s a hassle to even find anyone who does occupational therapy and then to find a place that books you weeks out to only treat you like this is unacceptable and if I could give them zero stars, I would talk to the Director, who could only apologize and tell me that she could reschedule me when I’ve already been waiting weeks  if that’s their policy and can’t accept one day outside when I had to accept being booked for weeks out, they are not professionals in any way shape or form",2024-09-30 09:12:48,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXKquYsvvtbP4k04M00AKErnz-nuq2njGsuqrXfEgk8t1mkMnP2Aw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:09:16.991059,,

The Therapists we have had the pleasure of knowing through our Granddaughter (of whom we have adopted), have been the utmost in all aspects..
She was non verbal up to a year ago and now actually talking! Her balance has improved so much that she hasn't  become car sick in more than 6mos..She attends both Speech and Occupational Therapies. Everyone there are hard working dedicated and actually like their jobs and that is really what shows enough about the whole facility.. I'm grateful beyond words.. our grandbaby has Williams Syndtome, she is only 5yrs old, she was born with many struggles and with the help of many she is now really thriving! Although we have a large hurdle ahead of us.. I am truly confident  that she will be ok in life and her struggles will be a little easier now..
I highly recommend this facility and All of the Kind most caring courteous staff here!!
I was apprehensive at first visit but now very happy because my Granddaughter is happy. She actually asks,"" me go bye bye in car?"" She wants to go even on the days she doesn't have to and the main thing I noticed is all the kids are happy there and wanting to go with each teacher! The Therapists actually greet each child at their appt time..They even reserve the last 5 min each visit to review what was worked on and what we can do to help at home..

However, the hard chamber hyperbaric treatment they offer is not REAL hyperbaric. They don’t use pure oxygen, just compressed air. There is no research done on hyperbaric treatment without pure oxygen, and it is as good as snake oil. In fact the whole point the pressure environment is for you to be able to absorb pure oxygen into your bloodstream. So there no real point to go into pressure without it.

Heart 4 Kids Therapy LLC,(813) 444-4290,ChIJmxCHy1PrwogRzCwzxI5FzlU,Heather Trowbridge,3,"My daughter briefly attended therapy here. Everyone was very friendly, which I appreciated. However, I have two issues (hence losing 2 stars):
(1) I asked her provider if she really found the visits to be beneficial because my daughter did not want to attend. She admitted it was not and said she supported us ceasing services. I wish that had been presented to me rather than me having to ask. If a provider doesn't believe the service is helping the child, it should be presented to the parent - especially when the parent is paying a considerable amount out of pocket!
(2) The billing situation is a mess. My daughter's insurance started kicking in after her deductible was met. They continued to charge the full amount for the last couple of visits because they hadn't actually received the money from the insurance company (even though I saw the benefit info and knew it would be paid). I didn't realize it was going to be so difficult to get my money back.  Her last visit - that I paid in full for, despite knowing the insurance would pay - was Oct 22nd. The insurance processed the claim on Oct 29th, and they typically pay very quickly. On Nov 6th, they sent me an invoice for a previous session, which the insurance had processed on Oct 23rd and paid. I replied Nov 8th with a detailed explanation of the credit that should be on the account and a request for refund. No response. I sent another email. I did not get a response until Nov 25th and was told I would receive a check in the mail in 60 days. Honestly, there is NO reason for that. By Nov 25th, the account had already been overpaid for a month, and now I have to wait 2 more months for a refund?

I also wanted to add one more thing - the way that the out of network insurance would work was explained was not how it actually worked. If it had been explained the way it really worked, I would have found an in-network provider.",2024-12-11 20:30:39,10 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWRwUDDEHiNQ6RnXmza5qX8PZbJketEmjasPJS0oEsjWkkBQ_1s=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:09:22.158898,,

Heron Lakes Animal Hospital,(954) 344-4911,ChIJR9sHWAoQ2YgROOU_Gy-q_n4,Shana Lardi,5,"Dr Lera and his staff have been taking care of my almost 13 year old goldendoodle, Lily, since she was a puppy. They have always shown such great care and concern for her well being. As Lily got older and some health issues arose, Dr Lera was always spot on with a diagnosis as well as making sure I was well informed as to how to manage it and what options were available.

Recently, Lily was diagnosed with bone cancer after suddenly fracturing her leg and subsequently had to have it amputated. Dr Lera has been so helpful and gracious with his time and advice through this difficult process even calling me back to answer questions while he was away on vacation with his family.

I am truly grateful for his compassion and knowledge in guiding Lily and my family through this difficult time.  I wholeheartedly recommend him and his team for all your furry loved ones needs.

A special shoutout to Rose and the blonde-haired woman whose amazing energy lights up the room. And I can’t forget the youngest team member—such a sweet and kind young lady. Unfortunately, my experience with the chiropractor has been disappointing. She lacks warmth and doesn’t come across as personable or attentive. Her treatment approach feels limited, relying only on the adjustment gun with no hands-on techniques, which hasn’t brought me any real relief. The sessions feel impersonal and rushed, and I haven’t felt confident in her care.

Hidden Palms Ranch,(407) 620-7880,ChIJLwFgA19r54gRC9DJzPo73yM,Eliany Torrez Pon,5,"Absolutely incredible experience!

Beki, the owner, is one of the sweetest and most genuine people I’ve ever met. I didn’t expect the owner to be so hands-on, but she’s deeply involved in every part of the ranch — and it truly shows. She’s a wealth of knowledge, made great conversation with our group, and also knew exactly when to let us just take in the scenery.

The ranch itself is absolutely stunning. I’ve never been horseback riding through a trail before, and now I don’t think I could ever go back to a regular ride — the combination of the horses and the beautiful trail views was unforgettable. We booked our ride at the end of September to catch the wildflowers in bloom. We were apparently a week or two early, but there were still so many! They were so tall they brushed my face even while on horseback — I can only imagine how gorgeous it must be at peak bloom!

I also loved that they take photos throughout the ride and share them with you at the end. It’s such a thoughtful touch because you can just enjoy the experience and still leave with beautiful memories captured.

Overall, this was an excellent experience and such a great value. I’ve looked into other horseback riding places that were more expensive, but Hidden Palms Ranch truly offers the most — and I couldn’t be happier with our choice. The small group size (only about five riders at a time) made it feel personal, peaceful, and special.

Jasmin goes above and beyond to accommodate her students, never pushing us beyond our comfort zones but always encouraging us to challenge ourselves. Thanks to her guidance, my physical fitness has significantly improved and my overall confidence has soared.

They do not serve Breakfast. How many calories is that? The green drinks are about 50 calories each and the greens and sprouts salad is —? The truth is many people weren’t really eating another full salad for dinner because they were so “full” (bloated) from lunch they couldn’t eat another whole salad for dinner. Some light foods are available on request if you choose to eat outside of their program, which a few people did.

I think if someone is in a weakened state, especially older people, trying to do the vitality program, this is not a good idea at all and can actually be very detrimental. And there were numerous examples of this that were not being properly addressed while I was there IMO. And trying to do a sustained lifestyle program like this long term is an absolute no!

I have stage IV cancer, and perhaps by the time you read this, I may no longer be in this body.

I became interested in alternative cleansing methods when conventional medicine could no longer help. I reached out to the Hippocrates clinic. Mr. John called me several times and warmly invited me to come to the clinic.

At the same time, he spoke rather vaguely about some package, the “1-week Vitality Program.” I asked if it was possible to add cancer treatment procedures. He replied that several cancer-related procedures would be included. He encouraged me to come, saying it would help.

Coming from Canada was a huge effort for me. When I arrived, I was shocked to find that they charged my caregiver. They charged her $170 for a basic room with a shared bathroom, plus an additional $350 per day just for the use of the facilities—even though she didn’t use any of them.

On the first day, they took my blood for an additional $200. On the second day, I received a Swedish massage for $170, which, as I understood, was included in the program. On the third day, nothing was offered at all. I became upset, also because the room was uncomfortable.

Keep in mind, all of this costs a huge amount of money, but even the best rooms are very uncomfortable and noisy—you can hear your neighbors. I simply couldn’t stay there. They promised to change my room, but never did.

I asked to see the program details to understand what was included, but they didn’t give it to me. So I offered to pay extra to receive IV Vitamin C. They agreed, I paid extra, and they gave me an IV Vitamin C treatment and oxygen therapy, along with a few other procedures and a paid consultation for $300.

To my surprise, although they sell a one-week program, it actually runs from Monday to Friday. You are expected to check out early Saturday morning.

It cost me about $10,000. I still don’t understand what exactly I paid for.

We agreed that the following week I would rent separate housing nearby and just come for the procedures. But I never got a response about the cancer programs. One of the big issues is that there is no information about these packages on the website. And even when you pay, they still don’t give you any package details.

Eventually, they sent me an offer for a $450-per-day ""Vitality passport"" program, which would give me access to all the facilities in the complex, even though I didn’t need the gym or pool. That wasn’t relevant to me. They told me I should arrange all procedures myself with the various departments.

And I kept telling them I felt very unwell. I asked them to simply understand my situation and help. I said I was willing to pay, but in the end, I wasted the second week staying nearby without getting any clear direction. Just vague suggestions that I should buy a new package. And that package included recommendations to take certain vitamins—even though my blood test showed I didn’t need them. So then, why did I need to do the blood test in the first place?

I’m very disappointed. I lost a lot of money, nerves, and health at this clinic. As I understood it, the programs and packages are very profit-driven. But they will smile at you. And to be fair, most of the staff are very kind and helpful people.",2025-06-19 04:15:55,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1lsKDRFvlR0G_vdJI2lEg-Fpp1oO5nOnyZbgQMHRpUhLIFXh_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:09:35.137620,,

Really really wanted holistic care for my aging dog but knew that specialty prices were something I can't really afford. Nobody in my town offers acupuncture treatment (the main reason I wanted to see this Dr) and so I committed to driving an hour to have my girl seen here. The initial visit with exam, bloodwork, thermal imaging, acupuncture, and chiropractic adjustment was a steep cost for me to budget but it was the care I wanted & chose for my dog. We weren't able to afford the Chinese herbal route (everything is 4x the dose when you have a large breed & most supplements or medications are considerably more costly to keep ordering for big dogs) but I'm so happy this vet is here in Central FL to have that option accessible. We didn't keep up with the therapy treatments as often as I would like, due to both the drive & cost, but this vet remembered my dog & treated us with kindness each time we came. She discussed options with me & didnt get a cold attitude when we were ""those people"" that couldnt afford every thing we'd like to do. She saw that I did what I could for my baby. The staff are friendly people. But the vet earned my trust. A week after our last visit, which I didnt know would be our last visit, Ava took her final breath at home. I have so much peace knowing that we got to come in 1 last time. Ava was as pain-free as possible in her final days. The vet prescribed me 1 last medication that I wanted to try. I have no regrets in being able to provide everything that I could for her. She was actually scheduled for another therapy treatment in the upcoming weeks when her time came to leave this earth.

Room 669 I had the best care your nursimg  staff  and physical therapist were fantastic they not only show professionalism but offered great care for myself and roommate with kindness and caring. However, you need to get your scheduling up to the standards of your nursing and PT staff. Who schedules a 78 year old man for PT at  7:00 PM after he has  had three PT and OT sessions.. This is bad for the patient and the care giver who is working hard to get his or her back on their feet. I worked very hard and I am not going to have the workout I should when I’m tired and getting hit with pains I developed during the day. My room mate Joel
has dialysis and is scheduled for a. 1:00 PM session but isn’t picked up until 3:00PM which means that he finally has a microwaved dinner at anywhere  between
8 or 9 PM. Your  nursing station needs work as well. I hit the call button and maybe someone will show up right away or anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes later. I understand that the nursing staff is very busy and overworked but there has to be a way to fix this. I am experiencing severe hand tremors but the review won’t allow me verbally complete it. So I spent a hour making this text. That’s  how strongly I feel that you you had to get my honest opinion of my view of your operation. So give all

The smaller office in Pompano Beach has  only3 therapists working at a time .  It feels very boutique like! Charlene is who I had for most of my post ankle surgery visits with ,  I thought she did an excellent job of pushing me  gently and guiding me through my therapy exercises.  I had Alex one day as Charlene was on vacation,  My therapy with Alex  went great and fit perfectly into the routine I established with Charlene,  he was excellent as well! The only problem I had was they are short staffed when a therapist takes aa break ,  I had 2 sessions cancelled, that disappointed me a lot bc I arranged my schedule to make all my appointments,  they really need an extra on call PT  person to bring in,  when staff is out sick. Tia the front desk secretary was also very kind and efficient in scheduling my appointments as best as she could with lots of patients and minimal therapists,  at one point I wanted to take a session down at the hospital to make up for a cancer,  but you can.  I learned once you start with one site, you can not switch between them unless your totally switch sites!

During our wait front desk staff loudly held personal conversations and had no sense of urgency to get our dog assessed. The vet tech that came out was amazing, she acted quickly and was very professional. She explained our options thoroughly. Our dog passed away while being transported to the table for X-rays. The vet tech and vet were phenomenal and we are thankful for the way they handled this situation. They were so kind. Unfortunately the experience with the front desk staff made an already difficult and emotional experience that more agonizing. They were so absorbed in their trivial conversations it appeared they had zero focus on the animal that came to their office for help. Given the amount of times we explained his condition to the front desk staff we believe they should have prioritized getting someone to assess him sooner.

Honor Murphy Physical Therapy Solutions,(321) 421-9144,ChIJDW_S29YP3ogR2OUmy3pTahw,KMW FABRICATION,5,"Honor Murphy has been hands down the best physical therapist I've ever used.  I'm a Journeyman Lineman by trade and run my own business on the side and I'm super active and always working.  I originally went through my normal channels of physical therapy through places I've used before.  I had a ACL repair on my knee for a second time (about 8-10 years in between surgeries).  I went to other physical therapy company and I always felt they weren't pushing me as they should.  Well insurance decided to not cover visits anymore and I couldn't pay out of pocket to continue my therapy at that facility.

Honor was recommended from my orthopedic surgeon and I wish I would have had her from the first surgery.  Not only was I able to cover my visits myself, but the entire time she is focused on your rehabilitation in a one on one setting, not 4 patients to one person.  She was also the only person to actually ask me what I do for work and the processes and physical procedures my body gets put through and tailored my exercises to strengthen those key areas.  Honor got me whipped back into shape so I could get back to work and providing for my family.  I am forever grateful we crossed paths and feel much better about this second knee repair.

Honor Murphy Physical Therapy Solutions,(321) 421-9144,ChIJDW_S29YP3ogR2OUmy3pTahw,Carmen Hendrix,5,"Honor helped rehabilitate my left ankle post surgery done to remove and repair parts of a torn ligament.  Surgery alone would have mechanically repaired the ligament, but Honor's therapy enabled the healing process of my foot, ankle, and leg to be complete.  During her treatment, she also worked to strengthening my foot and leg, due to the loss of muscle and flexibility, along with addressing the strain on other systems that comes with lengthy recovery times. My ability to use my left leg, or foot, and the ease of the strain on my right leg would not be complete without Honor's care during my recovery from surgery.  Honor demonstrates great skill and applied knowledge to any injury or rehabilitation.  She is widely experienced and highly competent in her understanding of how our bodies work as a whole.  She offers physical therapy along with instruction and understanding, facilitating not only recovery from injury, but also strengthening to alleviate the underlying causes.

Hope Haven,(904) 346-5100,ChIJxUAxJGS25YgRJz09VrCgTOo,juan Carreon,5,"We had an outstanding experience with Dr. Allison Cato, Director of Clinical Services and Neuropsychologist at Hope Haven. My son has ADHD, diagnosed by his pediatrician, and already has an IEP in his private school. However, we were advised to pursue psychoeducational testing to rule out other areas needing support. While county-provided testing was an option, the process seemed lengthy and overwhelming, so we decided to pay out of pocket to expedite the evaluation, even though our insurance didn’t cover it.
After weeks of searching with no success, we discovered Hope Haven and were thrilled they had availability within a short timeframe. Taking a leap of faith without much prior knowledge of the facility, we scheduled an evaluation—and I’m so glad we did!
Dr. Cato was professional, thorough, and incredibly kind throughout the entire process. She quickly put us at ease, explaining every step clearly and ensuring we felt supported. The neurocognitive evaluation was comprehensive, and we received a confidential report that provided invaluable insights into my son’s needs.
A special mention goes to Lauren, who administered the testing. My son absolutely adored her! She made the process fun and engaging, creating a comfortable environment that allowed him to do his best. Her warmth and positivity made a lasting impression on both of us.
Thanks to Dr. Cato, Lauren, and the entire team at Hope Haven, we now have a clear understanding of how to best support our son’s academic and emotional growth.

Our other kennel closed down and we planned an unexpected trip out of town.  They do require for boarding that you pay for a night and leave animals there (overnight) to make sure they will not have any issues with your pet(s).  Being that I ran a kennel for 4 yrs in the past I thought this was a great idea.  Porter our oldest has a bad back leg that never healed properly from his first owner as a puppy. They made an exception for him to have his bed.  Because of this when I picked up he was not lame or sore.  I'm greatful for that.  As for our shepard/x Roxie and our youngest Nugget the Golden Retriever they could care less if laying on cement or outside in the dirt.  I'm really glad we are now able to bring them where we can trust the staff and the fact that Roxie whose shy over meeting men did excellent when a man employee came out to get her when we returned for our initial trip.  That not only impressed me but made me feel so much at ease.  Last thing I would want is any of our dogs biting anyone out of fear. They are reasonable priced and we felt very safe leaving them there.  Especially since they have triple fencing outside.  Thank you again to all the staff at K-9 Emporium

As Jack’s OT, Mr. Eric brings such energy, creativity, and kindness to every session. His ability to connect with our son and help him grow is something we deeply appreciate.

Ms. Cheyenne has such a warm, positive energy that makes Jack light up every time he sees her. Her dedication and patience are unmatched, and her sessions are both engaging and effective. Ms. Heather is equally fantastic, kind, skilled, and so in tune with Jack’s needs. And we can't forget Ms. Cheryl, the clinic coordinator, she is truly the best! She’s so kind, organized, and always goes above and beyond to help with scheduling, communication, and making everything run smoothly. She makes the entire experience feel so welcoming and stress-free.

When I first signed her up, I wasn’t sure what to expect—she’s only a year old, full of energy, and still very much a puppy. But the transformation has been incredible. It truly feels like I have a brand new dog!

Cali now listens, responds to commands, and has a level of focus and self-control that I didn’t think was possible at this stage. Ariana was absolutely wonderful with her—so patient, professional, and caring. I could tell right away that she genuinely wanted Cali to succeed. She also took the time to work with us, showing us how to keep up the training at home so that Cali’s progress continues. Along the way, Ariana even sent me pictures and videos of Cali, which made me feel included and reassured about her progress. That extra support made such a difference.

It’s amazing to see how much more enjoyable everyday life is with Cali now—walks are smoother, playtime is calmer, and overall she’s just happier and more confident. I am extremely satisfied with the outcome and so grateful to Ariana for the incredible transformation.

Where do I even begin? Ariana is an absolute miracle worker. When we brought our Frenchie puppy home, he had serious aggression issues around food and certain toys. With three small kids in the house, I didn’t feel safe leaving him alone with them, terrified he might get possessive and lash out. We were heartbroken, thinking our only option might be to rehome him, until Ariana stepped in.
We enrolled him in obedient school at Ideal Dog Training, and she transformed him completely. I’m not exaggerating when I say he came back a different dog. He’s calm, obedient, gentle and the biggest shock of all, you can now reach right into his food bowl without losing a finger. That still amazes me every single day. Ariana didn’t just train our dog, she trained us too. She kept us updated with videos, pictures, and constant communication. Anytime I had a question, day or night, she responded immediately. Her love, patience, and true dedication to these dogs is undeniable, and the results speak for themselves.
I cannot say enough amazing things about Ariana and Ideal Dog Training. She took what felt like an impossible situation and gave us back not just our dog, but peace in our home. If you’re looking for a legit badass dog trainer, she is your girl 1000%.",2025-09-03 17:18:26,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocImkK8lrxjOOPUR6YfUParnYFry91kEX62Drho7Tm3kezT1tA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:09:57.660990,,

Impact Health and Performance - Clearwater,(727) 785-8737,ChIJ1f9LFvrywogRaqzPZjhTds4,Donna Nothdurft,5,"Now a retired occupational therapist/certified hand therapist,  I had the pleasure of working with Joe for a number of years in a local therapy clinic before he started Impact Health.  I recognized immediately that Joe’s knowledge and skills with an approach to patient treatment were above and beyond other physical therapists.  When I had a challenging patient, I would often reach out to Joe to consult with me.  Because I had taken numerous advanced courses over my career that addressed the total body in finding the root cause of a patient’s issue, I aligned with Joe’s critical thinking and hands on approach.
Recently, I now find myself as the ‘patient’.  Ignoring several years of pain in both shoulders, X-rays revealed significant arthritis.  Plasma, stem cells were not an option.  Due to pain & loss of motion, and functional decline, I opted for a right total shoulder replacement 3 months ago.  Doing self therapy, I now felt some additional help from Joe could speed my recovery on the surgical side and perhaps delay or dismiss the need for surgery on the left.
After the initial evaluation, Joe’s insight and  ‘hands on’ have already enabled me to have better insight and awareness of how to do my own therapy and I see slight improvement in motion.  Since I can’t do my own ‘hands on’, I am scheduling additional visits at IMPACT in hopes of resuming all my activities of working on our large property including using pole pruners, loppers, shovels, hand saws, painting and more;  and returning to volunteer at Caladesi Island State Park!",2023-07-12 13:12:03,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK6LTJeFEjoTHpnHDX8-L9dybBzSbiQFkBrs2Y7vwyTQ7-uig=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:09:58.215858,,

I can’t say enough about Jill and her hands-on therapeutic skills & touch. After several foot surgeries in the 90s (bunionectomy surgeries both feet/both sides & multiple neuroma surgeries on both feet) my feet were jacked up and neglected! This means I did nothing beyond my surgeries except to wear orthotics and never set out to strengthen already weakened and dysfunctional feet & ankles. I was able to be active but limited my potential for full strength and power gains from exercise efforts. I also put myself at an increased risk of injury. I’m so glad I finally decided to give some much needed attention & TLC to my feet.

What a difference from only a few months of therapy. I’m looking forward to greater mobility, strength gains and getting back to some good running with my new and improved feet and ankles!

I have to laugh as I hated anyone touching my feet and by discharge day with Jill, I was actually enjoying her hands on foot manipulations 😆🦶Bring on the foot massages now!

They could never really understand her and we would see no progress which led us to keep stating over. Inbloom has been a breath of fresh air and hope.

We get parent training and review her plan and goals 1-2  times a month.  She is celebrated when she walks in and when she leaves!

This form of therapy is highly effective and has been life-changing for our family. My daughter started off barely speaking and was unable to communicate her needs. Fast forward to today, she just Aced her spelling test in her general education class. She is thriving and it’s because of Dani and our InBloom family. I highly recommend this company.",2021-09-25 19:08:46,4 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUIHbtsnglmoDeOacFN5HURwl8HkZpQMOi0cHk9JWqnUZ6n5lILWQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5,2025-10-13 18:10:04.769814,,

Every session was a perfect mix of focused, professional care and lighthearted encouragement. It made a my recovery process feel a lot more manageable—and even enjoyable at times.

Juan followed up the in-office sessions with homework exercises that changed each week. He encouraged me to contact him outside of our weekly meeting if I had questions about the exercises or experienced unexpected pain.

Nicole exceeds all of my expectations. She not only listens but can validate, explain and offer support and guidance. I would shout Nicole's name from the rooftops if I could. I recommend her to anyone and everyone. She is extremely knowledgeable, continues to educate herself, and sets a great example of how to balance living with chronic conditions.

But after working with Nicole I now have an increased awareness about my body and how to improve my symptoms. I first met Nicole at another clinic and when she left I was determined to find her!  I could not imagine working with anyone else.
Nicole has an impressive background as far as her level of experience and credentials. And she has a very easy going personality that makes her a joy to work with!
She has designed and incorporated internal therapy, breathing techniques, and exercises that she has specifically chosen for my needs.  She easily adapts each appointment to what my needs are at that time.  And she has also made countless suggestions for doctors, products, and websites that she feels would be helpful for me.
Nicole's support and expertise continue to make a positive impact on my outlook and my health.  Her care has made it possible for me to have fewer symptoms and to be so much more comfortable every day.

She was absolutely correct.

I returned to pelvic floor therapy because the excruciating pain I was experiencing in my right thigh was suspected to be related to muscle tension originating from my pelvic floor.  Nicole listened carefully to my symptoms, confirmed it was a pelvic floor issue, and made sure that at no time was I unaware of or uncomfortable with the process of treating the problem.  I had immediate and significant pain relief after my first visit.  On my second visit I happened to have a severe shoulder injury that I was bearing out until an orthopedic specialist could see me. Nicole added that to the day’s treatment plan, resulting in my leaving with more range of motion in the shoulder and less pain than when I came in.

Since then, she has resolved my leg pain and continues to assist with my shoulder issue.  Nicole is empathetic, attentive, and creates a welcoming environment with both her personality and the clinic space.

On the first visit, Sarah explained what being in a hospital bed can do to your body and the toll that it takes on your skeletal system, muscular system and your overall strength. She found that I had very tight hamstrings- so tight in fact, that was effecting my leg length. One leg was shorter than the other because of the tightness of my hamstrings. Sarah worked with me and designed a workout that I could do daily to loosen and lengthen the shorter leg. I followed her workout instructions and three weeks later, it was time to work on both legs, not just one. Each session, she would measure my progress and I was getting better! We also worked on my hip flexors which really needed help! I am so pleased with Sara and JOY PT that i always recommend them when people even mention thinking of a physical therapist! Before my first hospitalization, I was very active. Afterwards, I physically couldn’t do much for myself and was concerned about my balance and overall strength and health.

JMS Therapy Services,(321) 536-0107,ChIJ8dVQYmcN3ogRzQP_qlw26H8,DJ Aponte,5,"My daughter Nicole has been going to JMS and Eastern Florida Autism Center / Great Leaps since around late 2021 or early 2022.

My daughter has grown so much going here.

The speech and ot services at JMS blossomed my daughter to the level she is at now. She loves going and always comes back with a smile and a new thing she has learned.

She went from not being able to eat a lot of things, to a kid that loves every vegetable and a lot of foods.

My wife and I both had bad experiences when we were kids, so we were so scared about leaving Nicole in the hands of strangers.

I can tell you that we see the Jms and eastern Florida autism center/ great leaps staff as family! Jamie and her staff take so much care of my daughter and teach her so much.

I want to give a huge shoutout to Derek, as he has been a key to my daughter’s success.

He understands my daughter and always makes sure my wife and I are updated with my daughter.

Derek goes beyond his call of duty to make sure my daughter is understood, and our concerns are listened to and understood as well

I love the monthly meetings that keep us in the loop, and Derek always provides us with so much helpful tips and new things we can try at home.

I also want to give a shoutout to Tabitha her teacher, Nicole has learned so much for her and her teaching of the emotional zones have really helped Nicole’s behavior so much!

Everyone is gentle and patient with our little girl. I know she is so loved

She went from barely talking to now full of words and developing her reading and other abilities

The aba services and great leaps together is making my daughter thrive and achieve new heights.

Everyday Nicole surprises us with new things she learned.

I can tell you that Jamie and her staff are second to none and I always am encouraging parents to take their kids there.

We just got my daughters IEP and true matrix score that will save us money and help get her the education she deserves, and we couldn’t have done that with out Jamie, Derek, and everyone else there.

From the bottom of my heart my wife Taylor and I are so grateful",2025-09-04 09:04:07,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBO9ZCOMUE9-BHoM6VR494ZKApqTIb0_Ro2a3X_xYIk3joqkT0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:30.237366,,

I rescued a shepherd mix a little over a year ago and genuinely struggled with managing her intense anxiety + low stress threshold, leading me to shy away from tons of social environments. I poured over resources online for dogs with similar reactivity problems and tried my best at acclimatizing her on my own. There were so many issues I felt at a loss as for where to even start.

At this point, contacting JP felt like a shot in the dark for me, but after our initial consultation, I appreciated how great of a listener JP was and how he provided his perspective. We worked through multiple sessions and gradually tackled scenarios that were always designed for the long-run instead of temporary solutions. There are days where I feel exhausted from reinforcing her routines, but being able to see my dog's clear improvement and her being more comfortable in her own skin honestly makes the effort all worth it.",2023-05-06 23:27:21,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0HkaeAU_A9cyAtwlr-HvcqxF7Q1rddJXMvRRYk6J_LzknDoY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:30.856154,,

Enough about the results, I'm here to give kudos to JOI. Both the surgery and the rehab went off as smoothly as I could imagine. I had about a week of in-home rehab, which was good, but JOI really impressed me with their professionalism and great attitude.
My therapist's name was Caitlin and I could not have had a better therapist. She has a great sense of humor and knows her job very well. I almost didn't want to finish rehab, because I liked it so much. After all, this is where I regained my motion.
The staff is very friendly and the therapists work together well. I wish all the best to JOI, and especially Caitlin.
Update 7 years later:
My knees are still working perfectly and I forget that they are artificial. I feel like I have 18 year old knees. My best advice after knee surgery is to move move move. And if the therapist wants you to do something, it may cause discomfort, but it is not going to hurt you any more than is necessary to get the flexibility you want.
I saw several people at rehab who seemed to be making zero progress, but they refused to push themselves when the therapist asked them to.
I hope your experience is as good as mine.",2024-09-07 11:02:20,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6D0TjhK5azy-QtuQMduod-deWbJ9prPElLBSifmLHZoRYSuM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:34.185762,,

Jacksonville Pet Crematory,(904) 731-3868,ChIJTxB12KBJ5IgRaacGgU-p8fM,Bill,5,"We have been using Jimmy's services for over 10 years and for numerous family pets.

We went this direction to be assured that the remains we received were actually our pet and only our pet.  While we trust our veterinarian, it wasn't clear who they contracted with or how that company actually handled the cremation.  We really like having the entire process handled locally and being able to trust the result.

We found that making arrangements at the front desk of the vet's office wasn’t right for us.  Jacksonville Pet Funeral Home has a large dedicated facility and we've been able to make these decisions in private without being rushed.  We have chosen from the the sample urns on display and we’ve also special ordered items in the past.  Everything has been high quality and the wooden items have held up very well over the years.

For us, the most important aspect of the service has been dealing with unexpected timing.  Jimmy prioritizes being available for pickups or meeting you at his office if you are bringing your pet to him.

For example, I’ve been to his office a number of times on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  In another case, he knew our veterinarian and worked out a pickup on a Saturday when the vet's office was normally closed.  Each time, this has kept an already stressful situation from being more stressful due to unfortunate timing.

I highly recommend this company and giving some thought to what you might do well in advance of needing the service.",2022-08-31 17:57:53,3 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLEpmVnjjvNQdh3h0Np2fCCEOY-RyGbJCNdXLq4obv9yC6npQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:37.046356,,

IF you can get anyone to answer the phone, there is an excuse for everything from scheduling to getting a prior authorization sent to your insurance! Apparently there is is only 1 person who sends prior authorization as we had to wait almost 2 weeks for it to even be sent off because the girl was in vacation. This is not our problem (cross train your employees, auths are NOT hard nor are they time consuming and it’s part of your job) but this halted medical treatment potentially being done earlier. We’re facing the same thing now. Who tells their patient that you will have to pay out of pocket if you don't wait until the prior with is approved, and it takes a while to get the approval back, but we’re not gonna send it until right before your appointment, for what ever reason, Of which makes no sense. Insurance has 30 days to respond to Prior auths and are good for typically 30 days, and typically if the member calls after its been submitted they can push it a little faster… they telling the people who work at the office that (at least the Cape coral office).

My dog can be a little nervous at the vet, but everyone treated him so gently and kindly. The surgery itself went smoothly, and the follow-up care was excellent. I really appreciated the check-in call the next day to see how he was recovering.

Jazz's Wonderland,(352) 570-0887,ChIJBQrsZhW56IgRNQr3DLKfiHU,Grace Nichols,2,"Update: after the company reply I looked on the website and it confirmed that the complimentary photos should’ve been expected every other day. Obviously it was spring break which I’m sure was busy which is why we didn’t want to pester the staff asking for updates but in hindsight it would’ve been nice.

Very nice facility with nice staff. We boarded our 8 month old here for 3 nights (our first time leaving her) and had her stay for a half day to see how it was beforehand. We really liked their hours, the fact that they go inside for their meals and sleep separately .She came back very tired and had a great time playing with the other dogs since we don’t have doggie friends and she loves to play. We also got a few pictures of her while she was there for her half day. Unfortunately we did not have as good of an experience with boarding. We only got photos of her the first afternoon of her stay after texting to see how she was doing . For the rest of her stay, we received no other communication except for automated messages seeing if we wanted to buy St. Patty’s day cookies. When my partner went to pick her up she noticed several puncture wounds on her head that had scabbed and stilll had blood present. My partner asked the staff who brought her up if she knew what had happened, she walked away and walkie-talkied others, returned and said she wasn’t present for the weekend and would have to ask someone else. We followed up, they sent us a short video of her playing when I asked if I could call to discuss the matter. Sasha was kind on our call and communicated that they do body checks every morning so it must’ve happened shortly before she was picked up. Unfortunately, since we only have photos of her from the first day, we had no way of confirming this. The wounds were small and we were able to clean them and with dogs playing this is a risk you take boarding anywhere but not knowing about it was very upsetting. She apologized for the lack of communication and said she would send the pictures they had taken to me (they did, not but I didn’t feel the need to see pictures). She said that they are supposed to send picture updates every other day during their stay and apologized (at our first meeting I was told we would get them daily). Our girl definitely had lots of fun and I had a good call with Sasha however, but because of the lack of communication, we will be considering other options going forward.",2025-04-22 09:52:02,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIKxcCQlnTnKikEzT3BOv-fMXIOjzPv2UQTiqQxBYrhMTLjQg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:40.475270,,

We were so stressed with not being able to control Lilah when guests or delivery people arrived at our home.
Her barking was nonstop and sometimes I was concerned she could hurt someone. The first visit with Nanette clearly showed we definitely needed guidance in training.

Nanette was so patient, kind and very understanding with Lilah and me!  after the second session Lilah was so excited to have Nanette come into our home she did not want her to leave! With patience and clear directions we have a better working relationship with Lilah and her continued training sessions.  Lilah is calmer and is gaining confidence everyday to do something new when the opportunity arrives.
Nanette provided easy to follow training guides for each session and suggested training books and videos related to the precise behavior issues we were experiencing with Lilah

We sincerely cannot thank Nanette enough for all her fantastic training tips that has changed our lives and provided us with better ways to cope with our crazy pup!

Our family would rate this training provided superior and we highly recommend this type of training with Nanette for that timid dog that needs a little bit of extra love and .

We had four dogs with very different personalities and challenges, and somehow she managed to connect with every single one of them using only positive reinforcement and clicker training. No yelling, no fear-based methods, just patience, clarity, and consistency.

What I love most is that she truly respects dogs as emotional beings. She taught us how to communicate with our dogs in a way that actually builds trust instead of fear. We’ve seen HUGE improvements in behavior, and honestly, in our bond with them too.

Her vet had recommended swimming, but at 12 1/2 years old and never having done more than splash around in a kiddie pool, I didn't trust that I would be able to teach her myself.

Given her age, lack of exposure, and the fact that snow dogs aren't exactly known for their love of water, my expectations were pretty low, but I decided it was at least worth a shot. Not only were the staff able to get her to swim, they did so much more quickly than even the most optimistic version of my timeline.

I had originally thought that I would take her here long enough until she learned to swim and then shift to swimming her at home, but the pool setup here is so much better for an old dog than our home pool (shallower pool, wide and shallow steps) that we've continued to make the trek for further swim sessions.",2025-07-08 11:48:36,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUTg55V_chd7iA9HznAer7TXKDrTdwauVoQYpsBVxTDa7NmNIsF=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:10:43.458336,,

We dropped our puppy off at 6 months for the 1 month board and train. Our goal was to have him walk well on leash and eventually have good off-leash recall. What we did not expect was the phenomenal behavior at home. He no longer begs for food, sniffs around the garbage, jumps on visitors, etc. We have taken him to restaurants, hotels, stores and even an assisted living facility to visit family and he is the perfect gentlemen. He is always over-joyed to go back to Jet Set U for boarding which is how I know he was treated so well. We worked predominantly with Lilli and Chanin but have a positive opinion of all the staff (as does our pup!). I would never have another dog that wasn’t trained here.

Our pup had severe anxiety and was extremely reactive to the point where we had talked about having to maybe rehome him. It was devastating, we had tried months of private trainers and nothing was working for the severe reactivity. Luckily we found Jet Set just in time. He did the training there for 6 weeks and came home a brand new dog! They are so committed to their training and positive outcomes, and we could really see that with their training structure. The usual training was 3 or 4 weeks but they kept our pup for 6 weeks to make sure he was well trained and that when he came home he was 100% ready. The change was incredible to see, he seemed so much less anxious and less scared of things. He was way less reactive, and learned ways to cope with his anxiety calmly. Chanin and Shantel did such an amazing job with him. They were so good with our pup, they were patient and kind and every time we went back for the training sessions with them he was so happy to see them which also made me see that he was treated very well while he was there and that he loved being there. Their training really made the difference between having to rehome our pup and getting to keep him knowing we could keep him safe and happy. Our sweet Indy is thriving at home now and living his best life!! They do such wonderful work at Jet Set University. I would 1000% recommend them to anyone thinking of training their pup!

It’s not easy giving up your pups for 4 weeks or potentially longer but the care that they receive individually makes me so comfortable to trust them with our dogs.

Long version: It was my idea to get a puppy-and  we found the perfect one, a little Pomeranian teddy bear Rambo! All was going well, except I would feel bad that we would leave and Rambo and would anxiously cry and shake-  my heart would break… We’re all he knows, and his comfort. This went on for about a month, when I had my second bright idea- Rambo needs a buddy! Enter Gigi. A confident , cute ( at the time:) 1 lb maltepom!
And while I could celebrate that Rambo stopped using me as his chew toy, he found a new love of chewing on his little sister- mostly by her tail. This all sounds sweet and adorable, which it all still is…. But my fiance and I were struggling to get anything done for ourselves, or enjoyably so - it was hard to communicate when we were both feeling the pressure of having new pups to care for . We feed them 4x a day ( they wouldn’t eat by themselves) , pick up all their tiny potties, weekly vet visits, Gigi getting pneumonia, , not being allowed outside, parasites, not being able to do vaccines …. It was one thing after the next… and we were new to this. Having any social plans together or separate was out of the question.
We called so many puppysitters- nothing seemed like a fit… we also didn’t even know exactly what we needed- we needed SO much help.
Finally, enter Jill’s next door pet sitters, and the amazing Melissa and Lori. The moment I spoke to Jill on the phone- in my frantic state- I knew everything was going to be ok. She listened, asked questions, took time to understand what we needed, and explained what their services could help with ( everything!) .
Rambo and Gigi get to see Lori and Melissa weekly, and love them so much- I’m able to pick time slots , and what we need that day… such as a walk, lunch etc. Lori and Melissa send a full breakdown of what happens in their time together along with the cutest photos and leaves us so worry free. Rambo chewed up his squeaky toy? Gigi pottied outside. Gigi chewed on Rambo’s leg like KFC chicken wing. The updates are adorable and make us feel so happy and guilt free when we go about our personal things. The peace of mind that Jill, Mellissa and Lori bring is nothing short of life changing. I truly don’t know how we would have been able to do it without them..

My only request would be that this could be offered in Los Angeles and Chicago :)

So if you’re on the fence about pet sitters, look no further- the best is right here.",2025-05-10 15:06:35,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWHUbTVZdEUBadM_HCqKCsrarhjxEp9KRppvdrJmBp88iFuBpqX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:44.707891,,

In full transparency once we got home, we thought we wasted a ton of money and the training didn’t work, but you only feel like that if YOU as the parent don’t put in the work.

All of that to say, we are extremely satisfied with JohnK9. Our Rocky was adopted back in April and we noticed some tendencies that we wanted to correct and this training did exactly that. We got constant updates on her and they didn’t make us feel like we were being a bother if we asked for extra updates, or called with questions and concerns regarding her stay there.

When we called for a tour, they were technically closed, we asked Savannah if there was anyway we could come in due to our schedules and she allowed it with no problem. We then met John, at first my husband and I didn’t even realize he was the owner, he jumped right in with what we where going to expect out of this training and everything out of his mouth was 100% true, he was real from the beginning. He stands behind what he says because he knows it works. Lily was Rocky’s main trainer (all of the trainers are phenomenal who work HARD day in and day out loving on our pup.) but Lily was just as phenomenal and knowledgeable on Rocky and her quirks during our exit session. Lily took the time to explain and correct us so Rocky could be successful when we went home. My husband dropped her off today and she had a bit of trouble but he said when Lily came out, she was super excited and didn’t even care about her being left there!

My first visit was with John himself. He was very thorough, and took his time to explain things. Even though there was a lot going on at the facility during my visit, not once did he rushed anything.

Alexis was my dog’s actual trainer. She is a compassionate yet so capable trainer and I couldn’t be happier. My dog Diego looked just as happy the day that he finished his 3 week course as the day he went in.

The entire staff truly cares about their patients and has always answered all of my questions and are very patient with my boys. They are encouraging and uplifting and have helped my son’s overcome so much and continue to help them overcome hurdles and gain more skills.

I also love that we can have labs drawn, some imaging performed, and see a number of the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospitals specialist at the East Lake location. This location is very convenient for our family. There is plenty of parking but it is worth noting there are two different entrances- one for therapies and GI and the other is for the other specialty clinic, imaging, and labs.

From the moment we met her, I was blown away by her skill, deep knowledge, and the incredible care and understanding she brings to every session.

Miss Marijcke has a special way of connecting not only with her patients but also with their parents. My daughter absolutely adored her, and so did I. When we were recently discharged, it was honestly bittersweet. While we were excited for our daughter’s progress, we were genuinely sad to say goodbye.

She knows exactly what she’s doing, speaks with clarity and confidence, and continues to learn and grow in her field. Beyond her professional excellence, she is a remarkable woman, a dedicated mother, and a gifted teacher.

Tara was the OT that evaluated my daughter, and we also had one session with her and she was fantastic. Sometimes during the 8-week program, we shared a room with another child, so I got to ""experience"" Rachelle's OT as well, and she was great with the kids. After completing this 8-week program, I have noticed some improvement in my daughter's sensory issues. This past week we have had several events that would have resulted in a meltdown before OT, and we actually handled very well since completing OT. Office staff has been a pleasure to deal with over the last year. The person I spoke to the most was Rachel with scheduling, who was always very nice and did her best to work with us on scheduling appointments.

The nurses and staff was great and friendly. From the beginning, both the doctor and her assistants were rude and seemed completely indifferent—not only to us as parents but also to our baby. It felt like we were just another number, not a family seeking care for a sensitive procedure.

Dr. Amanda explained that if we didn’t get the procedure scheduled within a few days, we’d have to wait until our baby was older and undergo general anesthesia. That seemed completely unnecessary and risky, and added a lot of stress. Scheduling was a whole ordeal—we were told to contact someone else who would then need to coordinate with Tampa General Hospital the appointment. We called the same day, and the person we spoke with promised a call back the next day or by Monday. It’s now Tuesday and we’ve heard nothing.

Julington Creek Animal Walk,(904) 338-9480,ChIJMUKb9MPO5YgRm-b517Y_HHU,Laing Welch,1,"I took a long time to write this review and debated whether or not I even wanted to at the risk of sounding like ""that mom.""

I signed up two of my dogs for daycare and received absolutely no confirmation and no one contacted me to confirm or deny.
Eventually, I had to reach out for ANY information.
After confirming, I dropped my lab off (her name is Riley, about a year old).
Upon drop-off, I received zero information on what to expect, the potential of getting any update during the day, etc.
After work I went to pick her up and again had to ask for any sort of update. The person at the front desk told me there were no notes which means she probably did fine. At approximately midnight that night, we received an email stating that Riley was nervous at first but eventually by the afternoon she was playing having fun in the pool.
I took her back for a second time and again received no information. But I figured based on the first report card she would be fine.

About 3:00 p.m. that afternoon before we went to pick her up, we received a report card that Riley was brought into a yard and snapped at a dog who ran up to her and was immediately put back in a kennel.

Hence the ""that mom"" part of the review.
My dog absolutely snaps at dogs when she's correcting them. I have several foster puppies in and out of my house and she has told many of them to not rush at her face, bite her legs or her ears etc.
I oversee every single one of her interactions with other dogs I bring in my home and not once was there an inappropriate correction or an appropriate snap.

The employees at this business clearly have zero clue about dog behavior. Allowing any dog to bum rush a brand new, already noted as nervous dog, in a new environment is inappropriate on all levels.
I have been working with animals in and outside of daycare for about 10 years. My previous job was actually a manager for a daycare, where we did new dog introductions, often.
If any of my staff had allowed this sort of behavior, quite frankly, they probably would have been reprimanded for an inappropriate reaction. Dogs need to be allowed to correct other animals.
I know my dog, I know dog behavior. Not one time has she ever overly corrected a dog. To put her in a kennel for the remainder of the day was absolutely insane and we're actually pretty angry we paid for my dog to get zero exercise and zero interaction.

We have not returned since and we will not return again.",2025-07-14 09:19:54,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL08wcGWH334ebAiQkXm7Nqee5P4HEkDGvBv9bA5743SOyfHA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:10:54.160783,,

They actually read (and took seriously) the notes I left about my freaky dog, and they were happily accommodating; using my notes about my freaky dog, they sent out the smallest female tech they had working when he arrived, and as expected he handled it well so of course I felt better about it from the beginning. Upon leaving, a tech was able to get his harness on after his first stay because she read the notes about what body language freaks him out. (Years ago I had to get him early from a different resort because staff didn’t read my notes about him so, as warned, he freaked OUT). Will be using them from now on. A+ from me. Thanks much. (Also very reasonably priced especially compared to chain resorts)",2025-05-05 16:24:14,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV39BKgBuXXOydberMmRMMMOTzgcALDQEAS0VH9jjvqj8DQf0Mi=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:10:54.160783,,

This harness is so easy to put on, and most surprisingly Bean loves it. I got the personalized patches too, and she is really a joy to take outside now.

K-9 Enrichment Center (K9EC),(239) 266-0400,ChIJGSYlzN1H24gR6YnqwXDrDoU,Karen Hamilton,5,"I adopted Tammi from the Cape Coral Animal Shelter 3 years ago this month. She was 5 months old. I saw her picture online and fell in love with her.  The litter had been dumped in DeSoto county at 4 months old. She was the runt of the litter & bullied by the other puppies who denied her food and she got very sick and almost didn’t make it. She was petrified of everything, and I knew she needed patience and love.  At the time I had 2 dogs with cancer. I had gotten Tammi when one was diagnosed so the other would not be alone when he passed but sadly that one got an even more aggressive cancer and they both passed away within 6 months of each other leaving Tammi alone.  She had built a bond with both of them.  The first 6 months that I had her she was too scared to even come out from under my desk except when to be with the other dogs. I couldn’t walk her. I had to carry her to get her in the car. Forget going for a walk; she would shut down and shake (she even feared the front door). I had never seen a dog so traumatized before. I boarded her for 2 weeks with a trainer in LaBelle hoping she could pull Tammi out of this but with minimal success and she wouldn’t eat the whole time she was there so she was skin and bones when I got her home, I vowed never to do that to her again. While she was at the trainers, she met a Siberian husky named Gwen, also a rescue, looking for a home... they bonded instantly, and I ended up taking Gwen home with us also. I decided to take Gwen in for routine puppy training. She was 11 months old and I found K9 Enrichment Center on referral from my Vet (Islandside Animal Hospital). I read the testimonials on Facebook and thought I would check it out.  Gwen loved it and after a few months I asked if they might be able to help with Tammi, who was basically fine in her home environment, but when I took her out of it she would shut down and shake uncontrollably with her tail between her legs. It broke my heart to see her like this. I asked Ryan and Crystle if they thought they could help Tammi come out of her shell & get more confidence. They said you bet we can.  We have now worked together for about 5 months now and the change in Tammi is amazing. It is baby steps but every day I see her gain more and more confidence thanks to their gentle loving training.  We hit a big milestone just a week ago where she used the doggie door for the first time (with the flap held up) Ryan & Crystle are giving her what she needs, and she is braver and more confident thanks to them.  We go every other Wednesday for day training now (Gwen goes the other Wednesdays). Crystle has even been able to comfort Tammi when she gets her nails trimmed after the Vet said they wouldn’t do it anymore without sedation because she freaks out so badly. Crystle just holds her and whispers comforting words, and it goes quite well. I am amazed and so happy with Tammi’s progress thanks to K9 Enrichment Center. I honestly did not have much hope for her being able to go on regular walks without her freaking out when a car drives by or when a loud noise is near her, she use to shut down and shake uncontrollably.  We both have more confidence seeing the world, and we are so excited to have found such devoted people to help us through this journey. We look forward to our morning walks now every day . I can never thank them enough for what they have done for us and plan on being a part of their family for a long time.",2025-07-23 08:36:37,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJhS3XnsRsX4sc_ibqKisltvSlYi20QjEFHkNX7hUu0ef-Xyw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:10:59.331287,,

My Mom sent me to training at K9 Enrichment Center in April 2024 for 3 weeks while she was recovering from an operation.  I had such a fantastic time learning with all of my new furry friends at k9EC. My Mom couldn’t believe how happy and relaxed I was when I returned home. When my cousin (he’s a Pomsky) used to come over, I was so nervous and a bit skittish. I never wanted to interact with him, I used to jump on my mom, the bed, the couch, just to try and get away. But, now.. after spending time with uncle Ryan and aunt Crystle, I am confident. My Mom even caught me napping with my cousin, the very same Pomsky I used to run from.

K9 Advisors Dog Training,(954) 923-3440,ChIJJWenwg-r2YgRKeuXupKZliM,Nikki Shapiro,5,"K9 Advisors has been absolutely life-changing for me and my dog, Hazel. From basic obedience to full service dog training, public access work, and even practice airport runs, they’ve gone above and beyond at every step.

Adam, Hazel’s trainer, is truly incredible. He’s not only extremely knowledgeable, but he’s also great at explaining things in practical, real-world ways that make sense. His love for dogs is obvious, but he also doesn’t tolerate any nonsense - he’s professional, consistent, and makes sure both the dog and owner understand what’s expected. Hazel absolutely lights up when he’s around and listens to him with total focus, which speaks volumes about his skill and presence. He’s exposed her to so many different environments (pet stores, grocery stores, shopping malls, the airport, my apartment, and more), and I can confidently say she’s become a well-rounded, reliable service dog because of his guidance.

Joelle, who runs the front end, is always so kind, responsive, and organized. She makes scheduling and communication effortless and really makes you feel supported. Edel, the owner, has also been amazing - he even personally stepped in to ensure I had all the proper documentation for Hazel. That level of care is something you just don’t find everywhere.

K9 Advisors feels less like a business and more like a family. Everyone there genuinely cares about both the dogs and their people. I can’t recommend them enough - if you’re looking for trainers who are professional, compassionate, and absolutely committed to helping you succeed, this is the place.",2025-09-05 14:51:13,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocII9_h1miw8EycJ1BhnYY9gf5YJESSMBYrjEjUwU2wutCySBQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:11:00.491494,,

Better yet, it seems to be making sense to my mischievous ""Dynamic Duo"", too.

The Pups aren't always bad, and mostly they are good. But a lot of times they get out of hand & have super aggressive (prey) instincts.

Adam is patiently helping me learn the ""language"" of my dogs, and after only two sessions, he has taught me how to tame their prey behavior (SUCH A RELIEF!)

I am so thankful!

The only reason I do not have a 5-star rating is because I had to purchase the training tools on my own.

Granted, Adam sent me a bunch of links to purchase these products. But it would have been so much easier if these training tools had been included in the training package...even if they added another hundred dollars or so to the enrollment fee - which is much smaller than I thought it would be.

Why was the fee so low? Well, unlike other training services, K9 Advisors doesn't charge per dog.

K9 Advisors Dog Training,(954) 923-3440,ChIJJWenwg-r2YgRKeuXupKZliM,Dana Nicholas,5,"This is an update of my May 2025 review.

After my first two sessions, I felt very blessed at the positive behavioral changes in my beautiful, fun and happy (but seriously misbehaving) canines.

Now it is four months later, and everything Adam has taught me feels like a miracle!

The kiddos suddenly have manners. They sit politely at the door when they want to go out or come in.

Their prey drive is nearly suppressed. They are no longer lunging at the fence when the dog next door is outside - or when the lady down the street walks her dog - or when the cat in my neighbor's backyard is rolling around the grass.

They can walk on leash with near precision - and without fear. We trained one at a time. Now both of them can walk on my left-side, in tandem, without any distractions (and without tripping me up by moving from side to side).

Bath time is now a pleasure! I have never been able to reign these guys into a bath. But Adam showed me how to gently lure them into the process, and they loved every minute of it!

My dogs and I can FINALLY go on car rides together! That is something most of my previous dogs enjoyed, but not these two. No way! But Adam came to the rescue again. With just a little momentum and an UP, UP, UP command, they are both happy to go for a joy-ride these days.

Before engaging K9 Advisors, I was struggling. I had a lot simmering anger at the pet rescue lady who persuaded me to bring two sibling pups into my house without telling me that it is nearly impossible to train twin pups at the same time.

But DANG, those twins claimed my heart right from the start!

It has definitely been an adventure and a journey, but I think Adam has now given us the balance that I so desperately needed.

Buster was in total control of our house and was counter surfing, chewing, jumping on people, pouncing on our 8 year old much smaller dog with reckless abandon, which I thought was playing until Ray quickly made me realize it was jealousy.
We had spent time with group puppy training which was not working well because of distractions and interviewed a company with great reviews that I was ready to go with and then I met Ray. As soon as I talked with Ray over the phone, I knew that we had found the right person to help us and when he showed up the next day for an in person meeting with Buster, he spent hour with us and Buster and he immediately recognized our challenge and that we were a big part of Buster’s problems.
It was very hard to think of leaving my dog with a stranger but Ray calmed my concerns quickly upon meeting him and off we went. After a week I was able to visit Buster and was able to see a significant change in Busters behavior and could see that he was happy and trusted Ray. After 2 weeks we joined in the training and realized that Buster was probably a lot easier to train than my wife and I. It has been so rewarding and eye opening to watch Buster learn to be a good boy, be obedient and see the confidence it has given him.

The training is realistic and tailored to real-life situations, which is important because our lives are far from ordinary.

Ray takes the time to understand your goals and evaluates your dog’s behavior with a thoughtful, no-nonsense approach. You’re not just learning tricks or commands—you’re working through everyday scenarios, which is exactly what we need as dog owners trying to improve our pets’ behavior.

His certifications and global recognition speak to his expertise, but it’s clear that Ray’s heart is in the right place. He’s licensed and accredited, which reassures me that I’m working with someone who knows what they’re doing.

I have an 8 month goldendoodle who was a complete handful in public, who would get distracted easily, bark at other dogs and strangers, and was horrible on a leash. I decided to call about 20 different board and train programs to find which one I liked the most, and I liked K9 department the most because of the knowledge and passion that Reza clearly had.

My dog, Yogi, was there for 3 weeks. He has come back a completely different dog. He listens on command, walks great on a leash, and has learned to eliminate the distractions around him and focus on me instead.

Above all, Reza cares so much about his dogs and treats them like they are his own. I was very nervous to drop Yogi off at a “strangers” house until I met Reza who eased my nerves and assured me he would be safe.

Of course, with any training, keeping the training up is required and I plan to do so. However, I am more than satisfied with the process that Yogi has made in 3 weeks. The walks will now be enjoyable again and I am excited to keep the training going.

Another thing I liked about K9 department compared to other places is that there was no strict “end date.” Reza assured me that he would keep the dog as long as he felt was necessary until he felt that Yogi was trained and ready to go. This is unlike many other board and train programs, who might say 2-3 weeks, and you have to pick them up whether they’re truly ready or not. Reza makes sure that his dogs are properly trained and cared for.

Further, he does his training in public places which I really preferred because the main problem with my dog was distractions around others. Regardless, Reza will tailor the training to what your dog needs and he will get the job done.

I highly recommend K9 department to any dog owner who is looking to do a board and train with a professional.",2025-03-18 14:03:43,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJMJMinthz3T6hOMZ9jNd0qQgoqIc1RS7sGkaidxpq2KjWqag=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:11:01.152634,,

K9 Off Leash,(305) 907-9505,ChIJb1UIZkmx2YgRCNTwjmxB_rs,Vanessa F,5,"Before finding K9 Off Leash Miami, we were convinced our 1.5-year-old Bernedoodle might be part dolphin. If there was a body of water—even a mildly suspicious puddle—she was in it. We’d spent thousands on in-home training trying to get her to heel, come when called, and most importantly, resist cannonballing into pools, oceans, lakes…you name it.

Enter Laura and her team.

After four weeks in the board and train program, our Piper came home with her same sweet, quirky personality, but now she actually listens (the E-Collar is essential to reinforcing the training). Like, really listens. I can walk her calmly at heel without her trying to tackle every lizard, squirrel, or rogue leaf in her path. She comes when called (even with distractions!), and best of all, she can chill by the pool with the kids swimming, and not treat it like her personal splash zone.

Laura and her trainers clearly love what they do, and it shows. We were super nervous when Piper left for the program (missed her so much) and of course, cautious based on past in home fails, but we are beyond impressed with the results and so grateful to finally feel like we’re in sync with our dog.

We couldn’t be more grateful for Chris and everything he’s done for our dog Loki. We signed up for 18 sessions with him, and the difference in our dog has been unbelievable. Before training, our dog was food aggressive, barked excessively at anything and anyone, pulled on the leash, and pretty much did whatever he wanted. From the very first session, we started seeing real changes. Now he’s calm, well-behaved, walks perfectly on heel, and has learned how to socialize properly with dogs and humans.
Chris is incredibly knowledgeable and straightforward, which we really appreciated.
He didn’t just train our dog — he trained us too. He communicated clearly, corrected us when needed (which was super helpful), and always made sure we were part of the process. His approach is firm, honest, and extremely effective. Also even though Chris corrected our dog a lot during training, our dog LOVED him, which says a lot about the kind of trainer he is.

K9 Spa Dog Training & Dog Boarding,(561) 622-5678,ChIJ03vUw_oz2YgRirINRZEwtTc,Sarah Simon,5,"5-Star Review for K9 Spa Dog Trainers and Boarders

K9 Spa has been an absolute game changer for our dog, Cato and our family. From the moment we walked through the door, we felt the warmth and genuine love they have for every dog they care for. Their team doesn’t just train—they connect. They took the time to understand our dog’s unique personality, quirks, and needs, and adjusted their approach with empathy and patience.

What truly sets K9 Spa apart is their personalized focus. Our dog wasn’t treated like just another client—they recognized her emotional needs, responded to her behavior with care, and used positive reinforcement to build trust. The commands were taught in a structured yet compassionate way, and we were kept updated on her progress with thoughtful insights into what was working and why.

The team at K9 Spa goes beyond basic training—they genuinely care. It’s clear they treat every dog as if she were their own, giving her attention, love, and tailored guidance. Our dog came home more confident, calm, and well-behaved—and we felt more empowered as owners, too.

If you’re looking for a place where your dog will be seen, understood, and cared for with heart, K9 Spa is it.

When we got a new puppy several months ago we elected to use K9 because of the manner in which they treated Max. We signed up for the 2week course.During that time they kept us informed of Remys , our new puppy’s, progress with pictures and videos.    At the end of the training Remy seemed to have learned his lessons well. However after several weeks at home his old habits of biting and jumping returned.  We called Pam And Mike and told them of our problems . After trying to fix the bad behavior by phone with us they agreed to take Remy back for some additional training and guidance.  They were not required to do this but nevertheless they did do it.  When Remy was done with his his remedial lessons they brought him back to my home and spent a great deal of time Retraining both my wife and myself.

My dog is now so much more confident, focused, and relaxed in situations that used to overwhelm her. It’s such a relief to see her progress, and I feel much more supported on this journey. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for humane and effective training, especially for dogs who need a little extra understanding.

KPro K9,(877) 457-7659,ChIJ7eNJvijH5YgRaUDp81HG574,Karina Valenzuela,5,"We tried the Board and Train for Behavior Modification and it was LIFE CHANGING! Gino, thanks for improving Leche's quality of life and mine! This is a long review but I wanted to give you more context on why we LOVE and highly recommend KPro K9 and Lead Trainer Gino!

We had always considered training and would say things like ""one day we will do it"", ""it's too expensive"" or ""I don't have time"" and unfortunately something happened that ""forced"" us to do it. My advice is DON'T WAIT! I can't fully express into words how amazing and mind opening the initial in-home evaluation was with Gino. He assessed her and told me things about her that I never picked up on. I had ""Dog Goggles"" for sure, I was blinded by a lot the things because she's my dog and such a cuteee! We started with at home training once a week however, our home dynamic changed when 2 dogs came to live with us. At first she was not the aggressor and during their last interaction she was the aggressor and we realized that she needed more specialized training for specific behaviors. The Behavior Modification training program was amazing because it was customized for my dog and not a standard package. Included was also a few more 1 on 1 training sessions after to assess how she and I were doing. Gino also took the time to explain the reason behind it the correction.

This is an investment for your dog and yourself, if you are ready to train your dog you HAVE to make the commitment and put in the effort to stay on top of training. It is unfair to put the expectation on your trainer, in our case Gino, to return Leche to us as a perfect dog and expect her to thrive in a different space. I realized Gino taught her all the skills at an accelerated pace and it was my responsibility to keep up with the training whether it's longer ones or smaller training increments like putting on her leash, going to potty, greeting guests, etc.

Gino has been absolutely incredible throughout this entire process, even till this day! We truly feel lucky to have worked with him and recommend him to anyone that has dogs. Hearing my family, neighbors and strangers make comments of how well behaved my dog is or how much she has improved is not only a testament to the amount of work and effort we have put in, but also to Gino as a trainer. He has worked with Leche on a 1 on 1 for weeks and with me after training  that we have been able to succeed thanks to his training.

1. LEASH WALKING/ REACTIVITY. Prior to training, she would pull, hop and yank, go side to side and bark at everyone. I had to wake up early and stay up late to ensure there was no other dog out. Even before leaving the house, putting on her leash was a whole other mission. These are all things we truly no longer have to worry about! He has worked a lot with me to change my mindset and keep her accountable prior to us stepping out of the house. I actually enjoy taking her on long walks and no longer avoid humans or dogs. REACTIVITY. She was reactive to everything and now can move pass those stressors. We still work a lot on exposure to different scenarios and sounds. As well as off-leash training and recall. We even had another dog stay over for a few days recently and no altercation, Gino helped us a lot with prepping prior. THANK YOU!

2. MENTAL STIMULATION/ ANXIETY. Prior, Leche did not get enough mental stimulation even though we have a backyard. Thanks to everything we learned with leash walking and reactivity I am able to give her more mental stimulation which has improved her appetite, bowel movements, sleep and anxiety. Her separation anxiety was terrible. She would follow me everywhere. Now I can freely move all around the house and she does not follow me. When we leave the house or come home there is no crying, whining or howling.

3. KENNEL/ CRATE TRAINING. Leche would free roam prior however working with Gino we quickly realized that by not putting her in one it was increasing her separation anxiety. This one took a little longer but it was worth it! Now she does not bark, cry, whine or pant.",2024-09-29 15:20:52,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUcR3xuu-p-2RroUwbiU3x3EQPJ_yTJ2ku_drD4hd5w6Q1acWd_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:11:09.709220,,

I had an amazing sole session w/ Kai Total Wellness, Tina last night that I had to brag about.  I’ve had a couple of these treatments in the past but last night was a extra special as she hand picked edible flowers and herbs from the  15th Street Farm for a fun sensory exploration first followed by a delicious flourless cake for my birthday celebration.  Her space is calming, dimly lit w/ twinkling lights, crystal bowls, rain makers and soothing smells of lavender.  To get started, I chose an oracle card and set my intention being open to whatever would pop up, lying on heated table under comforting blankets she works her magic while massaging my head and sends me into a relaxing yoga nidra.  She continues to massage arms, legs(knees down) and the best foot massage while continuing to play sound bowls clearing my chakras.  Ahhh.  What a blissful experience, I cannot wait to work w/ her for small group sound healing, meeting her at the farm for tastings, and more healing treatments.  I highly recommend reaching out to her for all of your healing needs.✨✨

As soon as I walked into this salon, I felt at ease.  The relaxing sounds of the ocean in background, lovely scents and Tina was extremely welcoming.  She did wear a mask, if you’re still unsure about safety, I personally felt bad she was wearing the whole time, but I digress.  I had the Transcending sole session and I absolutely loved the experience.  I highly recommend for total relaxation.  Tina placed a weighted blanket on me and also set up the salt air therapy machine which is perfect for congestion and overall good health.  She did sound therapy w/ crystal bowls and a short meditation to get in the chill mindset then an amazing leg and foot scrub and massage.  Wow!!

I understand its meant to be relaxing. But whoever decorated that place did a fantastic job with the decor. The moment I walked in I was greeted by Tina. She had a warm personality with a friendly smile.

I ended up getting the full package I think. I got a facial (first one ever) , massage and a salt therapy treatment. And they all were very very relaxing. Tina did a great job balancing communicating with me during the full experience about what she was doing and when since it was my first time. I was a little nervous. But the atmosphere and her friendly personality put me at ease and I was able to enjoy my experience.

One of the best things I enjoyed was after my treatment. Some people are pushy trying to sell you their products when you visit their business.

We boarded him for a week and had to drop him off again for another stay and he was so excited to play with his friends again. Tail wagging as soon as we pulled up to the facility!

Kamp K9 does require an initial evaluation visit and the owner will give you a tour of the facility. I’ve heard of some facilities not providing this type of transparency, so this is something I really appreciate. The dogs are crated for nap time and bedtime. There are both indoor and outdoor play areas, and medical needs/med administration can be accommodated to.

"Kari Mann Dental Studio: Advanced Dental Implants, Family & Cosmetic Dentistry",(239) 205-9136,ChIJTSmAsqhA24gR6cz8hcLqljo,Brooke,2,"I thought everyone was friendly, the building was clean, the amenities were nice, and the actual dental experience was fine. However, all that was overshadowed by lack of transparency in pricing. I had called prior to booking to get a quote for an initial appointment and the receptionist told me the price for the cleaning and the price for the xrays. During the appointment, the hygienist explained that we would need to do a panoramic xray and some quicker xrays in the room with the bite guard. I found out after the fact when checking out that these X-rays have separate costs and the price the receptionist quoted me was for the cheaper quick in-room X-rays not both, so I was left paying an additional $100+ for the panoramic X-ray that I hadn’t planned on paying. My appointment cost $389 and that was just for the assessment and X-rays, not including the cleaning since that whole process took over an hour and I hadn’t planned on being gone from children for longer than that. So now I have to pay an additional cost (who knows how much) to actually get the cleaning. I feel scammed because I would have gone somewhere else had I known the true cost of the appointment. Dentists are usually self pay so they should be held accountable for transparent pricing.

*Update* After reading the response by the office, now I’m offended since they’re basically calling me a liar. During the phone call, we discussed the pricing of one xray and the cost of a basic cleaning. We didn’t discuss the cost of the panoramic xray or the cost of an initial patient assessment. I’ll give the benefit of the doubt and this may have been miscommunication with what I was asking for, but at the appointment, there still wasn’t a discussion of the costs associated with the X-rays or the assessment by the doctor. I probably would have agreed to them after discussing the benefits, but it’s about informed consent, and my dispute is that I wasn’t given this. In my review I state that they should have transparent pricing for all services that are offered to the patient before the patient agrees to them. I don’t think that’s an attack on the company or unreasonable, and definitely not a reason to attack my character.",2025-10-10 09:56:31,in the last week,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKbg2ndZv1y4ZqDc5DxLAKt_WnDovJhKfYUb9IvwVvchPVXCYQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:11:12.588289,,

We recently sent our dogs to Karma K9 Obedience Training for their board and train program focused on general obedience, and we couldn't be more thrilled with the results – it was truly a fabulous experience from start to finish!
Before the program, our dogs struggled significantly with consistent loose-leash walking and staying reliably in place. We knew they had potential, but we needed professional guidance to unlock it.
From the moment our dogs joined the program, we felt completely confident in the care and expertise of the KarmaK9 team. Their communication was consistent and reassuring, with regular updates and photos that truly put our minds at ease while our dogs were away. Upon their return, the transformation was remarkable. Our dogs now demonstrates beautiful loose-leash walking – walks are finally enjoyable! – and can hold a solid ""place"" command even with distractions. It's clear they received not only expert training but also genuine care and attention.
The go-home session was incredibly thorough and helpful, equipping us with the knowledge and techniques to seamlessly integrate our ""new and improved"" dogs back into our home life and maintain their fantastic new skills.
If you're looking for a professional, effective, and truly caring solution for general obedience training, we wholeheartedly recommend Karmak9 Obedience Training's board and train program.

Katz Counseling and Educational Psychology,(239) 247-1756,ChIJC2fAEIRq24gRkqJj8qoez9k,p dawg plays,1,"Sheba Katz is the worst so called professional in SWFL. She is a highly unethical psychologist and brought harm to my son. My 4-year-old son was suffering from tremendous trauma right under her idiotic nose, and developed an eating disorder as well as other mental health disorders, but she testified there was NOTHING wrong with him in court. Her opinion was later contested by my son's pediatrician and other COMPETENT mental health professionals and appropriately diagnosed. After terminating services with my son 2 years ago, this devious woman came back on the scene by giving A FRAUDULENT REPORT to DCF that she was currently treating my son, that included all kinds of recommendations, when she hasn't seen him in 2 years (which I have in writing). Her report served to thwart the DCF investigation, and left my son without services. Before DCF received Sheba Katz's report, they were going to recommend the father get the services that were needed per CPT. Because of Sheba Katz, that didn't happen. This is a true warning to those considering this woman to provide services to your child...keep on looking for your child's sake! She is currently under investigation for fraud and malpractice. I am also in the human services field and therefore, it is my ethical duty to let the community know that this woman is incompetent and not safe for your child! If you have a court case DO NOT bring this woman into your family's life, because she will only leave them ruined and broken the same way she did mine.  When she was confronted with her negligence, lies, and the interventions it took to treat my son's issues that she tried to ""cover up,"" she deflected and blamed it off on others. She can not be trusted, but she is also not very smart because she was found out.

After a traumatic accident and surgery to repair damages to my index finger and thumb (partial amputation and severed tendons) my recovery required rehab with a OT specifically a CHT (Certified Hand Therapist).  Sharon was professional and understanding of the degree of the injury and her positivity for progress was reassuring from the beginning.  I always felt during my appointments that my rehab was 100% the focus as she walked me through the importance of doing each exercise correctly.   I am fortunate that I was able to keep my fingers but the luck that I will always be grateful for is being placed in the rehabilitating care of Sharon Keefe.  I walked in scared introducing myself to a therapist and I walked out confident with my rehab progress and having a new friend in Sharon.  Without a doubt the #1 hand therapist in my book.

Both my wife and I are doctors and we tried it all. We explored all options out there, involved him in the process of shopping, making food, giving him autonomy. We read all the pediatric psychology and nutritionist's tips/tricks, recommendations/books, but nothing seemed to work. When this class opened the idea of it alone seemed perfect. But once it started it was a Joy to work with Julie and see how our Boy became involved in the process. He loved learning about the food, prepping it, making art with it, and most importantly EATING IT!!!

He tried during FUN WITH FOOD all of the following things for the first time, and now enjoys eating them regularly: Grilled Cheese, Vanilla Ice Cream, Bagels, Cream Cheese, PIZZA!!!

He also tried and did not like many other things, but at least he tried them. It was a win-win every time. We will definitely be back for the next Winter Session. He looks forward to every class and is actually sad we are in a break for the next coming months.

Kids First Therapy Center inc Orlando,(407) 930-1000,ChIJCWMH51GH3YgRIc4SORVtJ4A,Anthony Gonzalez,5,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Laymi. She has an incredible gift when it comes to providing physical therapy for children, and her patience is truly unmatched. My nephew, who was recovering from a gymnastics injury, sincerely looks forward to seeing her, which says a lot when therapy can often be challenging for kids.

What makes Laymi stand out is not just her professional skill in pediatric physical therapy but the genuine care and attention she gives to every child. She is extremely careful in her approach, always making sure the exercises are safe, effective, and tailored to the child’s needs. You can tell she truly understands the emotional side of recovery as much as the physical side.

Laymi does not just identify problems. She offers a plethora of solutions. No matter what challenge comes up, she always has an answer, a plan, and a positive way forward. She keeps the focus on progress and possibility rather than just the setback itself.

Anyone who gets the chance to work with Laymi for their child’s physical therapy will be in the best possible hands. She is professional, compassionate, and deeply committed to the well-being of the kids she helps.

There was no real organization, kids were running around little babies, some kids were left in little rooms or cribs for up to 12 hours a day against the parents wishes/knowledge. Transport was awful because kids weren’t allowed to eat on the bus even though they could be stuck there for up to 4 hours; a few of those kids depended on the PPEC for breakfast. The food they did get wasn’t the best and the kitchen wasn’t very clean. The drivers for transport would also be on their phones. There were too many close calls with kids in the van. A few parents were under the impression that there were teachers present but there weren’t any, so the kids would be fighting over the tv and tablets the whole day. There was no real discipline for any of the kids either.

There were way too many safety concerns that were reported but never addressed as far I know and it was scary. A baby with a trach should not have kids playing around her oxygen/cords and a preteen with violent tendencies should not be placed in a room with 3-6 year olds.

Kids SPOT,(954) 580-2520,ChIJD-T-IKkC2YgRj68m1UbeeNc,ME Monterroso,5,"I actually started at Kids S.P.O.T. Hollywood, then I was thrilled when they opened their Pompano location and took my son there for a few years to receive ST, OT & PT. During this time, we had several therapists, countless evaluations, etc. and my son always received the most professional and caring treatment. Not only that, but we'd used his evals from Kids S.P.O.T. at his IEP meetings at Public School, and the same goals were used for his ST and OT at school so we were all in the same page and my son made great progress. Both Annie and Kristina (The founders) are very professional and their hard work has paid off since they now have several locations.  Joe, the office manager at Pompano, was always nice and helpful and he always dealt with any insurance issue that came up!  YES, I had some no shows. YES, I also had a few cancellations from them. YES, sometimes it was some last minute cancellation from either them or me, but LIFE HAPPENS!  Once you understand their cancellation policy, including arriving late (SPECIALLY for an evaluation and the implications this brings with the insurance companies) you would understand they do the best they can to accommodate each client!
As my son grew up, so did his needs!  I thanked them for their services, for all the years they helped my child grow in many areas of his development and I left in good terms because we all agreed it was time for my son to start a more intensive therapy like ABA both at home and a clinic. But I will always be grateful to all past and present staff from the Kids S.P.O.T.  family, both Hollywood and mostly Pompano where I spent countless afternoons during several years! Kids SPOT is part of his journey and for that I'll be always grateful!  -Maria",2019-08-15 11:34:39,6 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU59KccQRr7Vi5SH8yC4-WiP2rr1f87IfdN3nc9vIavlTB6euy8ug=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:11:26.328542,,

And I’m telling you it wasn’t easy, but I can say now that I’ve seen results, my son is saying words after the amazing therapist Anna Hurtado has been working with him and adapting different strategies to him. Also Ms. Maryela and Jenni with the occupational therapy, I’ve seen a lot of improvement on how he transition from activities on a daily basis and also on his sensory processing skills.

We have done OT before, but with little outcome. The first time I spoke with Charity I knew she would be able to help us. I wasn't even calling her for OT, in fact I had given up all hope of an OT working for her. I mistakenly called her looking for a mental health counselor to help with my daughter's anxiety. Quickly after calling we started discussing what is going on my my daughter...anxiety,sensory issues, temper tantrums, handwriting issues.. Charity was very knowledgeable about not just her specialty , but mental and physical health as well. She offered us to come in and do an eval. After the initial evaluation of my daughter it amazed me how much she picked up on. She  had evaluated my daughter from head to toe. The notes she took were astoundingly in depth and dead on accurate. She even urged us to see an eye doc which lead us to find out that my girl needed glasses!
Charity really is one of those amazing people who truly enjoys helping others. She has been nothing but kind and honest with us. When faced with so much complexity in life it really helps to have someone finally understand exactly what is going on and give you the facts. Charity has paired us with Janet, who is equally amazing. My daughter is not just working on her handwriting, but also getting a good sense of behavioral therapy , and calming techniques as well. And here is the great news. My daughter looks forward to her visits!!

Thankfully my card didn't go through and they had to notified me, otherwise I wouldn't had find out until afterwards. I contacted my insurance and they confirmed the 200 was wrong. I contacted the billing department ( which is the owner) and asked why they tried to charge my card without my knowledge or a notification and her answered was that I agreed to it when I signed the consent, RED FLAG. I asked to start paying in person at the clinic and she said they don't have a physical system and I needed to provide them with my card information so they could charge any debts from it moving forward, SECOND RED FLAG. I have worked in health care for 6 year, visit many clinics and doctors, and this is extremely weird and wrong. Still, I gave her the options to make my own payments online and she again refused, THIRD RED FLAG. After this she offered me a discharge from the clinic, which I was planning to do since the first red flag, but I wanted to see how far they would push.

Both Kacie & Danielle are genuine good human beings who are very good with my kiddos. We got very lucky with them. He sees Ashton for speech 1x a week too and with both therapists working With him back to back, he has gone from the quiet kid in class, to the jabber mouth! lol we love it! He is right where he needs to be. Ashton is super sweet and you can tell how genuinely happy she is to see my son. I can’t tell you how happy that makes us. We love you guys!

Ashley (PT) is exactly what my Sour patch, sweet & stubborn girl needed to get a routine down for PT. She is tough(still super kind), and we love that. A no nonsense PT who will really look out for your kiddo. She has done a great job with my daughter and has shown extreme patience(I see you Ashley!) - we are so grateful for you.

Jason (OT) is a go-with-the-flow OT who will make it work. Make what work? Anything! My daughter needed help with her handwriting, among other things. We kill 2 birds with 1 stone by getting HW done with Jason while she practices her handwriting at the same time. I am one happy momma to not have to worry about that too when we get home! Jason has looked out for girlie while making sure her goals are accomplished. Thank you!!

You guys are da best! Thanks for all you do!",2025-09-09 19:04:37,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjULO3aelZf8GrbmDd65DX1zrfSQwLsS_83Y6UqBAIqdK9k6ojppRg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:11:37.054832,,

I had a discectomy and laminectomy 4 years ago, and I’ve worked incredibly hard to maintain my ability to keep lifting and stay active—two things I’m deeply passionate about. Even so, I still get flare-ups that can knock me out for days, sometimes weeks.

Before and after my surgery, I tried it all—standard massages, deep tissue, “sports” massages—you name it. Not once did I walk away truly feeling understood, let alone better. No one had ever been able to get me back on track during a flare-up… until Gabbi.

She gets it. She listens. When I give her a rundown of what’s bothering me, she knows exactly where to start. She understands how one issue can cause compensations in other areas, and she works to bring my body back into balance. She knows her craft—simple as that.

Greer,5,"Last year, I went too hard, too fast in my running routine after coming out of a long break (I also transitioned into working from home full-time that resulted in trading walks across campus for lots more sitting). I blew my knee and experienced pain like never before. I couldn't squat, I couldn't walk or stand for long periods of time without pain. And of course I couldn't run. I found Leading Edge from a quick search and gave them a try. I am so happy I did! Within five weeks, Susan and her amazing team got me stronger, more flexible, and generally pain free! The mix of physical therapy technology tools, pilates, stretches, and strengthening exercises is top tier, as is the companion app that kept me accountable and engaged between sessions. I came in with knee swelling and a nightly routine of icing, elevation, and pain meds and graduated the treatment plan having completed short run for the first time in months and a new appreciation for squats and lunges! Thank you SUSAN, ABBY, GINGER, and SARAH for getting me back to myself! And special shouts out to NATALIE at the front desk who was always kind, energetic, and welcoming at every appointment.

Learning to Achieve Wellness,(813) 921-0389,ChIJQ2IItsrPwogRomgqFtU-luo,Emma,1,"My initial experience with this company was frustrating from the very start. All I needed was reliable medication upkeep and straightforward refills. Instead, it felt like I was dragging them along just to accomplish the most basic tasks.

When I first started with this company, they  tried to tell me I owed $420 for a hospital stay at Springbrook — a completely separate facility that had nothing to do with them. I had already been granted financial coverage through Springbrook, so I did not owe a dime. Had I not known better, I could have been scammed out of hundreds of dollars for a bill that wasn’t mine. That alone should make anyone cautious about trusting this company.

With my first doctor, every appointment felt like pulling teeth. She was consistently confused about which medications were supposed to be refilled, and I had to double-check and essentially babysit the process every single month to prevent mistakes. I wasn’t a patient — I was doing their job for them.

Then, when I was transferred to a second doctor, the problems only escalated. I am now being required (not merely advised) to undergo an EKG, despite having no insurance and despite having been stable on this medication for a significant amount of time. I have never experienced side effects or heart rhythm changes from it, and I know what to watch out for. Forcing a costly and unnecessary test under these circumstances feels completely out of touch with the realities of patient care

On top of the medical confusion, the billing department was another headache. I had to jump through endless hoops just to get financial assistance approved, and within only a few months of finally receiving it, I was told I had to reapply all over again. Not to mention, every single time I called the billing department they gave me a different answer on how much was owed and none of them understood what was actually going on.

In short: if you value clarity, consistency, and professionalism, this is not the place for you. Expect confusion, frustration, and to constantly babysit the process yourself.",2025-10-04 12:58:58,a week ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK3Zx2-WwZEQHPHIidQ0amjhiCy-tLtqsXBz6dCcQNw6VzrlA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:11:47.394455,,

I was amazed at what he did with him in just one day, then it just got better and better over the next 3 weeks. He learned so much as did we. Because not only did he work with Leo, he also involved us, we would meet up with them so he could see how Leo would act with us out in public. Leo got to where he was excited to go with Tyler when he showed up. Now that training is over Leo does miss Tyler, he wants visitation rights with him. Lol
We can now take our big boy out with us like we had alway wanted to without him pulling us around. He is a 200lb Great Dane.

We got Hazel as a puppy after having two much older labs.  We were also a little older so having a puppy again, especially a pup like Hazel, came as a shock to us.  We did a board & train with Tyler and Hazel came back to us a different dog.  She went from bouncing off the walls to obedient and ready to work.  From Day One, Tyler helped us understand why Hazel was so “hard” for us compared to our older girls and he taught us how to lead Hazel in a way that Hazel could understand.  He taught us how to keep her brain (and her nose busy) to keep her out of trouble, and helped Hazel learn how to chill.  We were really struggling with her prior to working with Tyler and he really helped her become the perfect dog for us and for that we are forever grateful.  Beyond dog training, Tyler is an all around amazing human being.  He regularly checks in on us and our menagerie of labs (yes we have since gotten two more) :).  He always offers advice and guidance, especially as we’ve expanded the pack he’s been there to help us navigate those transitions.  You’d be missing out big to work with anyone but Tyler!

Let's Talk Psychiatry,(954) 546-3142,ChIJVVWF1RQF2YgRkI3RgTLEgVI,Jorge Lopez,5,"After trying some online therapy services, I sought a solution where I could speak to a professional face to face. I found Latoya through my insurance and after doing my research, I decided to book an appointment, which was simple. I appreciated being able to fill out all of the intake forms online, saving me time.

Upon arriving I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Latoya herself and the wait time was virtually none which, being someone who is highly punctual, I also appreciated. After some minor confusion regarding my reason(s) for being there, Latoya was very polite and made sure I was okay with only being able to see her every other week for my purposes.

The rest of my initial visit was wonderful. Never once did I feel I was being judged and Latoya quietly listened to me and followed along even when I would veer off one topic into another. I appreciated her ""tough love"" approach of sorts which never once came across as rude, condescending, or accusatory; always tinged with good advice and trying to skew my way of thinking towards a more ""glass half full"" angle without being unrealistic or attempting to sugar coat anything.

Life Care Center of Winter Haven,(863) 969-5610,ChIJTVI3G4kS3YgRwyIuF30DHLQ,Tracy Kreider,5,"There are plenty of things I could list about this amazing place..

Hello! My name is Tracy Kreider. I am Anita Morrisons daughter.
I call almost daily and until my own health issues arose,  I visited my Mom every 8-10 weeks there in Florida- coming from Michigan..... I stayed at the house, multiple hospital visits and another facility before she was placed there a little over a year ago.
That was our dream to get her into that particular facility!!

It was the biggest biggest blessing that my mom was able to secure a bed there!!

I have beautiful memories of me and my Mom together thru my life and I've made some fabulous memories in the two years prior to her arriving at Life Care..

I am so thankful that Don is  there every single day and lets me talk to her on the phone and often we do video..

I have asked for everyone who was involved in my mother's care because I personally wanted to extend a heartfelt.
I have met or spokento a few of you..

I want to  Thank you, and write to each and every one of you as I thought I was going to be meeting everyone this week and this weekend.. however, I fell even more sick and lost my voice,  and have bronchitis...and I'm unable to be there and attend the auction and celebrate the day with everyone..especially Don, he was excited to go together.

The job that's done by each of you  is one that's so underappreciated, and one that most people don't understand all of what's involved every single day...

I would normally get there at 9 o'clock in the morning and stay there until 9 or 10 o'clock at night until I put my mom to bed.
I met so many of the different people along the way, and I loved all the memories that I made with my Mom..
I would do her hair and her nails. Give her a massage and then we would do different crafts together. I have long and yearned for all of that

So I wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for all that you do for her and the good times and bad, because I certainly know that there are some bad bad times but that was never a person that I knew in my almost fifty seven years of life...

My mom was a funny Witty, smart, talented woman, and my gosh, was she ever beautiful Classy and stylish!!

These photos are of the last times she was at her  home and me taking her  to the mall and to see Santa and go to the makeup counter,going to boktower where she was a docent there.. .. then her first faculty where I would walk with her everyday.. and do crafts.. she's changed a lot in just a two years.. the ones in the winterhaven was where I spent the most time aftershe was placed before she went home briefly.

Please enjoy these..
And thank you. Thank youthank you

Stephanie week daytime

Miki- weekend

Kia daytime head

Micheal evening week

Janelle- weekend head nurse just promoted and moved to hospice.. thank you for all you've done.. Don loves you and we thank you

All weekend nurses

First, doing a job that is Very under appreciated, most days are very harsh because it's in memory care, exhausting hours and so MUCH that's required.

The care, attention, sweetness, communication and so much more  .....you can dream about having people who day after day after day after day for weeks,months and years on end... POOOOUR OUT THEIR ENERGY into total strangers...

That..THAT THAT TAKES A VERY SPECIAL people...

Back several months ago TWO hurricanes back to back in Florida where Nafeesa, no longer there and her team hunkered down on the mattress on the floors to stay throughout the storm..

That's sheer dedication!!!!

Thank you so much!!

I want to start out by saying that Life Skills has been the biggest blessing my family and I have received. My son started at Life Skills as a “non- verbal” child in the spectrum. My son has achieved so many goals since he’s been coming to this office. Not only has his behavior changed for the better, he’s been more independent, he say so many words, expresses his feelings, plays and shares with other children, interacts well with other, is now learning to say full sentences and most importantly he is such a happy child. Everyone can see his genuine smile and sees how happy he is when he gets to the office and when I pick him up. Everyone is the office from front desk to the RBTs are all wonderful. Maria has changed our lives permanently. She has made a big impact in my son’s life and I am forever so thankful to have her as my son’s therapist. She is so loving and so caring, she is like a second mother to my son and I can’t ask for anything better than that. Along with Genesis who’s always been part of my son’s journey. She is such a good time and I love that she teaches him new dances and makes him feel confident. Dayanara and Alda are amazing as well. They are are always responding on time, are always available to speak to, very attentive with everything, and makes me feel so welcomed. The process was very easy when applying for services and in a timely manner. Honestly I couldn’t have asked for a better place to take my son. They most definitely changed our lives for the better.

LifeStance Therapists & Psychiatrists Fort Myers,(239) 310-4646,ChIJx1tBSE8_24gRPQrwqER55TE,Caleb Freeman,1,"Honestly I dreaded doing this because of “Fear of retaliation” & with the followers and viewers my profile receives, I never want to “Bash” a company.. I just simply never participate again.

My experience with this psychiatrist’s office has been deeply frustrating and disappointing. From the very beginning, it became clear that professionalism and patient care are not their priorities. Phone calls are almost never answered, and messages are rarely returned. For a medical office, this level of inaccessibility is unacceptable, especially for patients seeking consistent support with their mental health.

In addition, there is a clear pattern of pushing unnecessary sessions, which feels more like a strategy to generate revenue than an effort to provide genuine care. Appointments themselves often feel rushed and dismissive, leaving me with the impression that my concerns were not being heard or taken seriously.

The most damaging issue, however, has been their neglect of critical documentation needed for work and daily responsibilities. Failing to complete or provide this information has created additional stress and complications in my life — the very opposite of what mental health care is supposed to accomplish.

Mental health treatment requires compassion, attentiveness, and professionalism. Unfortunately, this office demonstrates none of those qualities. Instead, patients are left feeling unsupported, dismissed, and taken advantage of financially.

If you are considering this practice, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. There are providers who will respect your time, listen to your concerns, and prioritize your well-being. Sadly, this office is not one of them.

I’m concerned that writing this review might delay the important documents I need to maintain my job. They claim that you need six visits for them to even inform your employer that you’re seeking their assistance. Of course the appointments are WEEKS apart, how can I afford these six visits without having supporting documentation that I’m actually seeing them?

Just be very careful and weigh your options. There’s tons of Mental Health Professionals and Centers that will 100% Treat you right.",2025-08-21 09:27:55,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvoDJbYCVJqpC3NxHJDw6fariA1KRoknp9Yw6cKUtQBtiKaZi3Tw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:11:57.810863,,

As  medical sociologist and as a patient this is a nightmare. It's a shame because I liked the doctor but the red tape and BS outside of the doctor has been more exhausting than I, a person with progressive MS and chronic migraine, have time to deal with

As a medical sociologist (UM MA 2016), it is critical for a practice to have systems set up for patients to at least leave a message but this incompetent practice and the staff behind the doctors are less than useless and I am just tired.  Too tired.  After attempting to send five portal messages on various devices in a row and there being no voice mail option and not getting calls returned, I'm done with this place.   Maybe someday they'll get it together but for now they are an inefficient office with a broken website and that is not a great thing for someone's mental health. Go somewhere where more than just your individual doctor but the people who set up the practice actually understand patient needs and what they are doing and have failsafe message options for when the patient portal is down.

If you know doctor Fritz going to his office feels like coming home!
He also does DOT physicals/CDL medical certification for drivers, he’s busy but truck drivers seem to love coming there too!

She has a gentle, encouraging way of guiding conversations that helped me explore my thoughts and emotions more clearly. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I began to feel more grounded and capable of managing what once felt out of control.

She communicates about his progress regularly and provides him with practice to do at home to accelerate his progress.
We had to stop going for a few months after the last hurricane because my work schedule changed. I noticed that he kept the speech he learned with her, but was not making additional progress.

When we started, most people - even close family - had a very difficult time understanding him.  He was quite vocal but blended letters, avoided others, and then there were just some sounds that he couldn't quite get.  It was frustrating for him, and was negatively affecting not only his confidence around others but also his introduction to reading. Fast forward to today and he has close to all of his sounds down.

I am very glad we chose Lighthouse because it seems there is more than just meeting benchlines and goals in their approach to teaching.  My son looks forward to his time with Ms. Alicia - they play games, create art, and work on speech along the way.  For a child who typically dislikes anything resembling a curriculum or forced learning, his excitement there is impressive.  She makes him happy, which makes me happy.

I’ve been to a few Pilates studios, but the level of personalized attention you receive at Lighthouse Pilates & Physical Therapy is unmatched. From the very beginning of each class, Mary checks in with everyone individually about any trouble spots (for me, it’s always my neck and hip), and she tailors the session accordingly—incorporating exercises that both strengthen those areas and work around them when needed.

Mary is incredibly intelligent and has such a deep understanding of the human body. Being a physical therapist, she ensures that everyone is performing the exercises safely and with proper form. Anytime I perform a move that doesn’t feel quite right, she’s quick to offer modifications and explains why my body might be reacting that way. I trust her with my entire soul. All of my friends who have come to this studio have raved about it—and many have found their new Pilates home here.

The studio and equipment are in immaculate condition, which only adds to the top-notch experience.

Ms. Ursula has been an absolute blessing in my son’s speech therapy journey. From day one, she has shown incredible patience, dedication, and expertise in helping him make tremendous progress. My son has autism and struggles with expressive language, but Ms. Ursula has tailored her approach to fit his unique needs, making sessions engaging, fun, and highly effective.

One of the things we appreciate most is her ability to connect with him on a personal level. She understands what motivates him, incorporating his favorite characters and interests into therapy to keep him engaged. Whether it’s using visual supports, interactive games, or hands-on activities, she finds creative ways to make learning enjoyable. Her encouragement has helped build his confidence, and we have seen a noticeable improvement in his ability to express himself.

Before working with Ms. Ursula, my son had difficulty forming sentences and articulating his thoughts clearly. Now, he is using longer phrases, engaging in more conversations, and showing excitement in communicating with others. She has also given us invaluable strategies to use at home, ensuring that his progress continues beyond therapy sessions.

Ms. Ursula’s kindness, expertise, and unwavering support have made an incredible impact on my son’s life. We are beyond grateful for her dedication and highly recommend her to any family seeking a compassionate and skilled speech therapist. She has truly been an integral part of his success!",2025-02-03 14:29:39,8 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI3DKfhtJzacPGOxB78601R5_grJbmwj1j7nMeV5OEtRnkefA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:12:03.112720,,
Lighthouse Therapy Center,(407) 990-2847,ChIJq6o6qzKH3YgRQssVPYc4ctk,Karla,4,"I stumbled upon them while working at a near by office in the same building and went in to ask a few questions about speech therapy for my then 18mo. I was told that I could have someone come to the daycare since it was near by, but later I was told that due to availability it was not feasible for only 1 child. I was a bit upset, but understood.

I requested a bilingual person because it is important for me that my kids grab Spanish as well as English plus I also teach them ASL. We have been paired up with Cindy and my daughter, now 2, absolutely loves her. She runs out the car into the elevator and even though still having a bit of a hard time speaking (she is stubborn) she knows to press the numbers when I tell her and then runs out to the office door before I am even out the elevator! It is awesome to see her get so excited, sometimes too much, to spend time learning one on one which is hard for me to do while taking care of my baby. Cindy is also very flexible when I need to have a schedule accommodation and understanding when last minute things happen.

She has always kept great open communication while in sessions and out and I have even been told of a possibility to now see my daughter at the day care, but I turned it down because it was a different person and we just love Cindy. Don't get me wrong everyone is great, even the other girls my daughter enjoys being around them and they all greet us with respect, but of course my daughter has built a special connection that I do not want to break plus I am happy with her process in Spanish and Sign Language. Even my almost 1 yo loves coming here as I let him run around the wait room while we wait for my daughter and he loves to play with the toys and the books, gets a little upset he can't go with his sister but still enjoys just running around.

All in all Lighthouse is amazing. Would have given 5 starts if it wasn't because of the original miscommunication as being a single mom with 2 under 2 it can be difficult to find time after work to do these things. Other than that, it is a great place with knowledgeable staff. Even the interactions with the other families I have seen is great. If I could get another referral to also put my 1 yo I would because it is so helpful aside from their daycare because it truly does take a village and I consider Cindy as part of mine.",2023-05-23 13:46:23,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVZ4p-wRAkClu8GZ-YmDdiCuW7WOU4hebkiZHPhWCEPt0oZAziy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:12:03.112720,,

Lighting Behavior Services,(305) 515-2726,ChIJBT1LQlal2YgRVG_xy3nI4mA,Jorge Rolando Toledo,5,"Observations from an accidental visitor,
To Chamile and Anabelli,
I had the opportunity to attend the birthday celebration of my godson, Jorge (George) Daniel Toledo last month at your facility. I was very impressed with what I saw. Yadira, his therapist was very loving and understanding with him. The interactions were positive. I could say the same about Gretel, his analyst.
In fact, though the children were having fun, not one child was unattended. They were watched and taken care of at all times. I could see that these women were doing their job, but, what mostly impressed me is that they did it with dedication and love. All these children deserve that extra ingredient and they are receiving it at your facility.
As a retired nurse for many years, I have worked at different hospitals and have met patients with all kinds of needs. Medicine, surgeries, treatments are essential, yes. However, it is the dedication, the extra effort, the caring smiles, especially towards children, that matter the most for them to heal and progress.
I have noticed that little George has made tremendous progress since he has been at your therapy school.
This is why I am writing this letter to you. I want to praise the work that these young women are doing day in and day out, with the enthusiasm and dedication that I witnessed from them. I would appreciate if my comments are passed down to them.

With appreciation,

Little Movers,(904) 990-3915,ChIJ4XY9dLHFwogRNSm9QzX7Xjk,Veronika Khalikova,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I want to share my story and express my immense gratitude to Anna and the entire Little Movers team!

My daughter Amina was born at 24 weeks and spent her first eight months in the hospital, unable to master even the simplest skills. Daily sessions with Anna were nothing short of lifesaving: in just a few months, Amina not only caught up physically with her peers but also made an astonishing leap in her cognitive development.

Anna is a consummate professional of the highest caliber! Her boundless patience, genuine kindness, and keen attention to every small milestone make each session feel truly magical. She employs the most up-to-date methodologies, seamlessly blending compassionate care with a rigorous scientific foundation—and the results speak for themselves. Thanks to her sensitivity and enthusiasm, Amina didn’t just learn; she blossomed into a confident, happy, and curious little girl.

I honestly don’t know what we would have done if we hadn’t met Anna during the most challenging period of our lives and our daughter’s life.

The progress has been incredible. Her left side became more active, she started using both hands equally, and her balance really improved.

After discharge from hospital, Sofia could barely hold her had and wasn’t active at all. The neurologists that we visit didn’t tell us how we can improve situation and suggest to wait. Two month later things didn’t change much. During this time, I tried some PT facilities, but we didn’t make progress. When Sofia was 4 months , we were lucky to finally find Anna and Little Movers. It is the best recovery facility we could find. The progress that Sofia made in less than 3 months is truly incredibly amazing. We went the path from baby who could barely hold her head to a baby which actively balances on her forth, can sit without support and even started babbling. Anna has a unique approach to every client. She not only simply train Sofia but also do it in a playing manner, adjust every class based on schedule and Sofia’s condition. Little movers truly did a miracle for us and we believe that with their help things will get even better. They not only give you support but also a help and hope.

Little Tesla Pediatric Therapy,(321) 732-3723,ChIJ5dAtxyF_54gRsXQYa8hSM9k,Destini,5,"I absolutely recommend Little Tesla Pediatric therapy to all families seeking therapy services for their children. My son has been a part of LT for a full year now and truthfully this review is overdue because Little Tesla has exceeded my expectations from my first contact with the clinic when I first had general inquiries as I had to search for local therapies as soon as my son received his Autism diagnosis. I remember my sons psychiatrist gave me 3 pages full (front and back) of local clinics, and Little Tesla was the ONLY clinic that was thorough, and detailed as well as providing additional peace of mind as this was going to be my son’s first exposure to an open social setting outside of home. All that to say my son now attends ABA 4x a week with included Speech & Occupational Therapy.

At first we started with only Speech Occupational Therapy as there was just a small wait list to be established in their ABA program. We waited roughly under 3M as we joined in the summer time, and by August my son was already enrolled. I’d like to specifically highlight the care of the RBTs, my son and our family has had the pleasure of working with such as Nate, Dina, Naire, Anna, Marie, Jaz, Angelique, Amanda, and Kirstie. Gosh, I forgot the names of the few others we’ve worked with in passing, but they are all truly amazing individuals who have reassured me that they take great care of my son while supporting him fully during each session. I’d even go as far as saying that they have felt like an extension of family, as they’ve grown to really love my son too (it’s hard not to since he’s so bubbly) but for all of the RBTs you can tell they love what they do.

In the full year my son has made AMAZING progress. I can confidently say my son’s speech has improved, as well as both his social and behavioral development. Ms. Joyce I’d also like to give credit to as Emory’s speech therapist, she has the most kindred spirit, and because of her my son can speak in fuller sentences now, identify himself, state his address etc.

I could sit here singing their high praises for hours, but aside from the RBTs that work with my son everyday. The administrative staff, management, BCBAs and owners are all incredibly kind, and personable! Just to drop some names Aleema, Jasmine, Ashley, Andjela, Victoria, and Vesna. These ladies have now a special place in my heart because they all are so compassionate in their approach, never mind the clinic itself, with the recent expansion I was blown away to see how the new clinic goes above and beyond to provide even further support for daily living skills, behavioral, social needs and more!

LT has become our home away from home and I leave my son here 4 days a week with full faith and trust in the entire staff here because they are truly amazing.

Living Waters Wellness Port St. Lucie,(772) 302-9580,ChIJsTF9hyDv3ogRy5gzOVCDdrI,Adoption Airfare,5,"I am quite impressed with the treatment plan at this amazing chiropractic office I’ve been with for about 4 weeks. I feel my absolute best ever with the laser treatments and everything they do for me here.

The staff and doctor Gagney are all so kind and welcoming and supportive. I tell everyone that it feels more like a spa than a chiropractor because of all of the pre-adjustment modalities they use to support the adjustment itself.

Before coming here, I would come out of alignment quite easily, but I stay in alignment very nicely here at Living Waters. I can’t say enough about the positive atmosphere. They even have worship music playing softly which promotes healing in many ways while undergoing treatment. The spiritual aspect of this place is very sweet. It almost feels as though the whole staff meet together and pray before the patients arrive.

I hear other patients talking about how they are experiencing healing of their ailments here. This really is important to listen and hear what other patients are saying when they come into the chiropractic office. One time I heard someone talking about how they are only coming about once a month for maintenance now and he mentioned how it was because they “fixed” him. I thought this was amazing. They truly do everything and beyond to help fix the problem vs. creating problems.

I also LOVE my customized balancing shoe inserts!! Wow! I am amazed at the state of the art, high-tech equipment they use to treat their patients. They have you stand on a device that shows the exact areas that your foot needs to be supported in order to re-align your posture. Who does this?!! Amazing!

You might be surprised that you won’t “need” them for too long, but you might come back just because you WANT to experience your chiropractic spa day every now and then as a treat to self!! 😊",2025-04-10 12:56:48,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuCe_gX78eQOoJKOmHOr_68UbEykll94MlLj8XtnyUFoazElX_Qw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:12:18.553228,,

Lone Palm Stables,(352) 596-3213,ChIJd2POGSsZ6IgR8jm5JSsanGY,Dielle Dahmer,5,"As a 39-year-old who just embarked on this exhilarating journey of English horse riding four months ago, I can wholeheartedly say that Lone Palm Stables is a gem. From the moment I stepped onto the property, I felt a sense of warmth and community that is truly unique. The trainers at Lone Palm Stables are not only skilled but also incredibly passionate about sharing their knowledge. Each lesson I’ve taken has been tailored to my needs, allowing me to progress at my own pace while continually building my confidence. The trainers create a supportive environment that encourages questions and exploration, which has made my learning experience all the more enjoyable. One of the standout features of this stable is the horses. I can’t express enough how safe and wonderful they are to ride. Each horse has its own personality, and it’s evident that they’re well-cared for and loved. Being matched with such reliable companions has made my learning process exciting and, above all, secure. I genuinely feel that God brought me to Lone Palm Stables, as my journey here has not only been about learning to ride but also about connecting with like-minded individuals who share a love for these magnificent animals. The sense of camaraderie among the riders and trainers creates an atmosphere that makes every visit feel like coming home. If you’re looking to start or continue your equestrian journey, I cannot recommend Lone Palm Stables enough. The combination of knowledgeable trainers, safe and wonderful horses, and a nurturing community makes it the perfect place to learn and grow.

However, watching my 6 year old daughter ride and develop a passion for horses in a very short time, has made me want to share the memories together. Claudia is our riding instructor she has an amazing gift working with riders and horses. I have taken lessons off and on my entire life and have never felt more at home then I do now. She is amazing with children and is able to teach riding to small children with finesse. She explains things simply, and if your still unsure you breaks the skill into smaller steps. My daughter in such a short time has made tremendous growth in her riding abilities. I also am building my confidence to jump again. Claudia is able to adjust to your tabilities and confidence. She builds you up and pushes her rider forward to be the best they can. Even more because of this love we purchased a pony and will be sharing our memories with our wonderful barn family. If you want to learn to ride both children and adults this is the place. Claudia and Emma can help you and your family as they with mine reach your equestrian goals and dreams. They become a part of your family and celebrate all of your riders growth and accomplishments. They are patient and love there wonderful team of lesson ponies and horses.

Now, I am fortunate enough to be a part of the Look Up Therapy team. When I first started, I needed health insurance, and typically there is a grace period before coverage begins. However, Christian and Tiffany waived that three-month period so I wouldn't go without insurance, demonstrating their genuine care and support for their staff.

In my experience, I have never worked for more supportive bosses. Having worked for many schools and agencies in this field, I can confidently say that none compare to Look Up Therapy.

At just over a year old, Miles was full of energy and had a hard time focusing on even the simplest commands. Walking him was a challenge, especially around distractions like other dogs.

Thanks to Joe’s expert training and guidance, Miles now walks calmly beside us on a leash without pulling, listens attentively to commands, and confidently holds his ""place"" position—even choosing to go there on his own to relax. It’s amazing to see how much calmer and more focused he is.

What really stood out about working with Joe was the communication. After each session, we received detailed updates outlining what Miles had worked on, what progress was made, and what we needed to practice at home. The videos and photos of their training sessions were an added bonus and really helped us stay engaged in the process.

I was nervous at first with how the results would be, but man was i satisfied with the results. Joe the owner was very knowledgeable and from the moment he arrived, I could tell this was a passion of his.

Overall, I highly recommend this Joe and his company to anyone looking to improve their dog's behavior or strengthen their bond.

He attended day training from about 6 months old until he was a little over 2 years old. We typically did 1-2 days of day training a week. We also took a loose leash walking class together in the evening with Toni, and a CGC and Rally class with Alexa.

Lucky Dog was a huge help in ensuring our young rambunctious Labrador had enough mental stimulation when I was at work all day. They also ensured he was matched appropriately for play time with like-minded dogs. Lucky Dog helped ensure Brisket had good obedience foundations that made him a very good boy, and also created the ground framework for advanced training in Agility, Rally, and Dock Diving. I owe a lot of Brisket’s success in Agility to the great basic foundations he learned for how to think, how to learn, willing to work for other handlers, and having a great attitude for sit/stay/come.",2025-07-09 12:06:30,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJm7VVqjtdBkE_ufnGfCcuibZbT3tbEElhIJ0WhkLufDfwYNow=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:12:24.466441,,

I have the sweetest mini golden doodle that I wanted trained as a service dog for my 16 yr old autistic son. It’s amazing what you can teach animals. When he is working as a service dog, he is by my son’s side and does everything that we ask him to do. He stays in place and he is by his side. We also want him to be a normal dog where he can be playful with our other animals, but when he is working, he is doing just that, and he is doing what he is trained to do, to be there for my son, and give him the comfort that he needs at home and out in public. Ryann Is dependable, kept all her appointments and showed up on time. She spent extra time with us even over the phone. She is there to answer any questions, and assure us that everything is going to be OK even when we felt like we were struggling. Now we did do our part, Ryann came weekly,  and gave us homework, and we did just that, we had to do our part to get our dog where he needed to be for my son. I am so glad that we met Ryann. She will be available to us at any time we need her. It’s only been a couple weeks since Teddy graduated and we miss her already, and my son misses her as well. Our dog knew that when Ryann was here that she meant business and he did exactly what he was being asked to do. If you didn’t think a dog couldn’t be trained, Ryann showed us differently!

I have been rescuing Basset Hounds for 31 years. Coolest dogs on the planet. I am recently married at 65, my lovely wife has two ridiculous English Labrador Retrievers, Daisy & Duke. Duke is 100 lb Black male, Daisy a 85 lb yellow female. Both English. Minnie is European. They are quite the pack. Minnie Pearl hurt her back 3 weeks ago. If you are familiar with Basset Hound's a back injury is normally not manageable on a 9-10 year old dog. We saw Dr Hobson. She is the the lead Vet there and her accreditations are extremely impressive. It's like WOW that's some education for a young woman. She is very intuitive and gains a lot by ""laying hands"" on the dog. It's an art that's hard to find any longer. When you realize that the person in front of you is much more educated than you and you love your dog....you follow the lead and take direction. Dr Hobson is NOT a ""take this pill and call me in the morning"" doctor. She entertains many holistic options. As a two time cancer survivor everything I do is holistic at this point. Dr Hobson suggested Acupuncture. I've never done it. She had me agree to 3 treatments before I made any additional decisions. I agreed. I took Minnie Pearl to the first treatment. She could barely walk. I has some confidence because I realized that I was dealing with a very well educated, extremely talented doctor. Doctor Hobson gave Minnie Pearl a little electro stimulation as well. The whole staff loves Minnie Pearl. Taking her home from the first treatment she was 80% better. We have had treatments every week since.. Minnie Pearl is completely off medication of any kind. We are. now moving to every other week. The treatments are packaged and discounted. Today was already paid for as part of a package. She is walking, running and playing with the pack again. She is sleeping in the bed , eating and loving life. We are very grateful to Dr Hobson and the entire staff for saving my girl. The Acupuncture really works. Of course we had the right Doctor and Team.

Stack was extremely nervous, but the vet techs were incredibly patient, kind, and sweet with him. Their gentle approach made a big difference and helped ease his anxiety. I could tell they genuinely cared about his comfort and well-being.

A special thank you to Luci who was so helpful and understanding when we ran into an issue while checking out. She remained kind the entire time — never once making me feel uncomfortable or rushed. Her professionalism and warm attitude made a stressful situation so much easier to handle.

Thank you all for taking such good care of Stack.

I had done a lot of research of different vets in terms of treatment, before & after care, the procedure itself, and comfortability for my fur baby making sure it would be a great place for both her and I. Based off my experience here I would continue to recommend this vet. When I called the first time just to get information and a breakdown about the procedure, what it entails, and pricing, the lady at the front desk and the vet tech were so helpful and friendly. They were very patient with me, didn’t push anything on me and answered all and any questions I had. When I brought my puppy in they immediately welcomed her and made her so excited and happy she peed (multiple times lol). Before the procedure itself the vet tech went over everything and still answered all of my questions even though I was running late in traffic they weren’t annoyed at all. My puppy Nala got the best care both before and after!! She doesn’t even seem to be having any pain and I’m on day 3 after the procedure! She is still her feisty, playful, talkative self like nothing even happened!!

They immediately put us in a room. Both the tech and DVM examined her and explained the orders they anticipate and their associated prices clearly. They were able to examine, XR, draw labs, attempted to obtain a UA x2, administer medication, give subcut fluids, and dispense prescriptions within 45min. Lilly is so much better today and I will be using them in the future as this appeared to be a far less traumatic experience for her, despite all the pokes and prods, than I think it was for me 😉

It's so different than any other veterinary clinic or hospital I've ever been to. Not only were every single member of the staff there kind and genuine. Every one of them had a sense of compassion that isn't seen much anymore. You can tell every single person that works there enjoys what they do and the whole place has a family dynamic feel.
To the receptionist Britt thank you for your kind words and listen to me ramble while I stressed about how anyone was going to be able to treat my mean kitty, and then you and Kara dog sitting  Pascal while Peper got her shots. Being able to trust my dog was in safe hands took off a huge amount of stress from the visit.
To the vet tech Daimyan, thank you for making me not feel insane and sharing stories of your cats and that's it's not uncommon for them to be stressed at the vet. Hearing my cat isn't the only one causing a riot helped a lot. Your compassion within your practice showed and it's no wonder you do what you do. Your way with animals and calm  demeanor  really helped the visit go smoothly.

My most important Thanks goes to Dr. Basso. I physically cannot describe how grateful I am towards you. I was probably acting more insane than my cat, and honestly the fact that you most likely took more time to calm me down and really talk me through everything and make me feel like my fur baby was in a safe space, and you understood and explained to me why she was acting that way. It really just blew my mind. I feel like a lot of times people just want to go,go,go. The patience and understanding you had is not seen often. You truly have a gift the fact you were even able to give her shots blew my mind. You were gentle, calm, and so in tune with not only Peper's feeling but my anxiety too. You gave options about plan of care and had a great sense of kindness. Only veterinarian that is allowed to take care of my babies from now on.😂 But in all seriousness you were such a big help in more ways than one, thank you so much.

I had such an amazing experience with every single person I interacted with here. Thank you guys so much for taking care of my furbabies❤️

Martin Integrative Animal Clinic,(786) 269-0960,ChIJhRUvN-y_2YgRp1PQYXw2EfM,Adena L,5,"Dr. Martin saved our dog’s life!

In January 2025, our dog was diagnosed with severe anemia and pancreatitis. Traditional medicine was not helping her at all (and may have actually been making her worse). After doing a lot of research we found Dr. Martin.

Dr. Martin immediately started treatments including a new diet, supplements, herbs and vitamins while testing for the root cause of the severe anemia (and actually confirming the root cause quickly).

Within one month of seeing Dr. Martin and implementing her treatments, the pancreatitis was gone. Within two months, the severe anemia was cured and all of the bloodwork was close to normal after being in the “critical” range for many weeks. Every day our dog is getting her energy back and improving. It’s absolutely miraculous.

Our dog was in such bad shape- she lost almost 20 pounds. If we would have stayed the course with traditional medicine, she absolutely would have died. The regular vet and the emergency vet couldn’t figure out the root cause of the anemia despite so much testing (bloodwork/ X-rays/ ultrasounds). They proceeded to treat her with a lot of unnecessary medication and never addressed diet, nutrition or environmental factors.

We can’t say enough great things about Dr. Martin. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable, she is so kind and so compassionate… just absolutely amazing. She has an obvious love for animals. We trust her completely and now we won’t take our dogs anywhere else.

Also, she is super honest and cost-conscious. She never pushes unnecessary treatments or products and she always explains prices very clearly.

Her clinic is clean and lovely. Her family and her staff are always warm and welcoming. This is truly one of the best animal clinics in all of Miami, if not the very best.

I began seeing her during my pregnancy and continued postpartum. I am a firefighter/EMT so maintaining my strength during pregnancy and postpartum was vital to me. Her care has been an absolute game changer for both my physical and emotional recovery.

Throughout pregnancy, she helped me prepare my pelvic floor and core for labor, always taking the time to explain what was happening in my body and how to support it. She explained what to expect better than my OB-GYN. After my C-section, I was feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to heal properly to get back to work—but Dr. Hamilton provided expert, compassionate care that made all the difference.

One of the most impactful treatments was the shockwave therapy she used on my C-section scar. I had tightness, sensitivity, and limited mobility around the incision site, and after just a few sessions, I noticed a huge improvement. The scar softened, the discomfort lessened, and I finally felt like my body was truly healing.

She creates a safe, welcoming space where you can ask anything and feel completely supported. Whether it’s pelvic floor dysfunction, core rehab, or scar treatment, her approach is caring, evidence-based, and incredibly empowering.

If you’re pregnant, postpartum, or recovering from a C-section, do yourself a favor and book with Dr. Hamilton.

From my initial evaluation with Brad, I was met with respect, focus, and compassion. His knowledge and demeanor set a strong foundation for the journey ahead, immediately giving me confidence in the process.

One aspect I especially appreciated was the clarity and structure of the treatment plan. It was written in such a way that any therapist on staff could seamlessly provide guidance, which ensured continuity and consistency of care. In my case, Judy took over much of my treatment, and she carried forward the same professionalism and attentiveness I experienced at the start. The plan was straightforward, easy to follow both in the clinic and at home, and allowed for steady progress that reflected the effort invested in each setting.

The overall atmosphere of the facility also deserves mention. It is professional yet welcoming, with every staff member contributing to an environment that fosters both comfort and motivation. Even the front desk and scheduling team demonstrated the same level of professionalism and courtesy, making every visit smooth and stress-free.

From the initial consultation to the final report, the process was well-structured and clearly communicated.

Sally took the time to understand our concerns, asked thoughtful questions, and created a comfortable environment for our child. The assessment itself was comprehensive, covering cognitive abilities, academic skills, and emotional and behavioral functioning. The psychologist was patient, professional, and engaging throughout, which made a big difference in helping our child feel at ease.

The final report was detailed, easy to understand, and included clear recommendations tailored to our child’s needs. We now have a better understanding of our child’s learning profile and how best to support them both at school and at home.

We went back to our vet who admitted we should have been referred to a dermatologist first.  We then made the dermatology appointment and thank God we did, because Ellie subsequently developed mast cell tumors (MCT’s) that were discovered by the dermatologist so we ended up being referred right back to Dr. Padron at MedVet for the tumor removal.  The dermatologist felt that Ellie’s ear mass might be an MCT as well, but Dr. Padron is of the opinion that it is probably not, so we will find out next week when Ellie undergoes removal of the confirmed MCT’s and a biopsy of her ear mass. We so appreciate Dr. Padron’s opinions and look forward to removal of Ellie’s MCT’s.  He and his office are very professional and they take the time to listen to our concerns and understand how important Ellie is to us.

This is actually my second time at Miami Physical Therapy Associates, and they've proven once again why they're simply the best! I first came here 8 years ago after tearing my right Achilles, and when I unfortunately tore my left Achilles this time around, there was no question where I'd go for recovery.

After 11 months of dedicated therapy, I'm not just back to normal - I'm better than ever! My therapist Alex was absolutely incredible throughout both journeys. Their expertise, patience, and encouragement made all the difference. Juan provided amazing additional support that kept me motivated even on the tough days.

The results speak for themselves: I've lost over 100 pounds during my recovery and I'm walking better than I have in years! But beyond the physical improvements, the entire team at Miami Physical Therapy Associates made me feel welcomed and supported every single visit, just like they did 8 years ago.

Everyone here is not only highly skilled but also extremely friendly and genuinely caring. The consistency in their excellent care over the years really shows their commitment to their patients.

If you're looking for physical therapy that delivers real results with a team that truly cares about your success, look no further. Miami Physical Therapy Associates has helped me recover twice now, and I'm forever grateful!

We tried everything: Epsom salt soaks, diet changes… and while some things would help for a bit, the relief never lasted. It got to the point where Koda wasn’t even sleeping well at night, and we knew it was time for a professional evaluation.

We were determined to stick with a holistic approach and thankfully found Miami Vet Group—and we couldn’t be happier. From the moment we walked in, the experience was different. Koda was visibly nervous, but the entire staff was incredibly kind and patient. They showered him with gentle attention and affection, which not only calmed him down but also helped ease our anxiety.

Dr. Rodrigues took her time with us, truly listened to all of our concerns, and answered every question we had. She gave us clear, detailed instructions and made sure we left with everything we needed to get Koda on the path to feeling like himself again.

We’re so grateful to have found such a compassionate and knowledgeable team, and we look forward to continuing Koda’s care with Dr. Rodrigues.

My dogs tend to be anxious during vet visits, but the team here was so gentle and patient that they quickly relaxed. The veterinarians took the time to explain everything clearly and answered all of my questions without rushing.

What stood out to me most was their integrative approach. They don’t just treat symptoms, they focus on the overall well being of the animal. From traditional medicine to holistic treatments like laser therapy and nutritional guidance, they truly go above and beyond.

I also use Mind Your Manners for overnight boarding when we go on trips, and it’s so nice to know that she has fun playing with other dogs, brushes up on her manners and training, and gets to be treated as one of the family!

Needless to say after 2 weeks we had a well behaved wonderfully trained puppy.

Nick puts genuine thought and care into every session - tailoring movements to what my body can handle and slowly helping me build strength and confidence.

I began my journey at Miracles on May 9 after two weeks in a detox. I began in their PHP program, completed the recommended four weeks, and expected to maybe stay a month or two in IOP. Once I arrived at Miracles; however, I felt like it was where I was meant to be. I have completed a few other PHPs, but none before Miracles did I even start, let alone complete, IOP. I wanted to stay in Miracles IOP and sober living longer than the average stay, and was able to work with my therapist to have my time in the program extended more than one time. In all, I was at Miracles for five months. I was able to learn from the treatment program, attend outside meetings, find a sponsor and work the steps all while living in Freedom Housing with affordable weekly rent. I am also currently reliant on crutches to walk or get around at all, and they were accommodating to my physical disability. I was able to stay on my medications for mental health and substance abuse with regular visits with a medical provider. I finally felt “at home” living and attending treatment with Miracles. I am forever grateful for my time in the program and everyone who helped me during my extended time there. I would highly recommend Miracles for someone who has completed detox/residential treatment and is ready to get serious about their sobriety and recovery.

Miracles Recovery Center,(772) 362-2176,ChIJeS8e_qfp3ogR5EIVsEsaakM,Brenda Sullivan,1,Hi my name is Brenda and I'm a 56 year old mother of 3 beautiful children and several grandchildren. I have been an addict for many years and have been to a couple of treatment programs over the years and it was one of the hardest things I have ever done to make that phone call. Getting to the point... I went to detox at the Haven detox facility and I would recommend the Haven to anyone. Upon leaving the Haven I was transferred to Miracle's Treatment Facility in Port St Lucie Florida. This has turned into one of the worst experiences I have ever experienced in my life. Let me be clear on a part of this review... Not everything about this facility is bad. There are a couple of amazing people that work there and by no means am I taking anything from those people. My counselor Miss Jodi is amazing and she helped me more than she will ever know.. thank you Miss Jodi I will never forget you. The only person that contributed to my bad/awful experience was the Housing director named Eric. This man is evil and has a major attitude problem. He's on a massive power trip and is just hateful and mean to people. He's best friends with my roommates son in law and put me out of the program because my roommate said she was missing a bra. He never one time gave me a reason and is yet to address the issue of a missing bra with me I was made to move out of my room or I could leave the program! I begged them to search my stuff to prove I didn't have anything that belonged to her but she had a complete meltdown slamming doors cussing him and screaming to the top of her lungs at him and he did absolutely nothing about it! I was put out of my room and told I could either move it or he would move it for me and would put my stuff on the side of the road. I had most of my belongings stolen by my prior roommate there and nothing was done about it at all but I'm being treated this way over a bra that I never took! When you tell this man about any of the problems concerning the house his response is always you can tell me your complaints about the house but the answer is always going to be no! I am left speechless as far as this man and his behavior. My heart is completely broken and my recovery has been hindered. I was supposed to coin out on the 5th of October and because of all this mess I find myself walking around a place that I have absolutely no idea where I am or anybody in this state waiting for a bus that won't come until 1:40 am this is the worst situation I have been in in a very long time. This man don't deserve the position he has been entrusted with. The girl who accused me of taking her bra is three times my size and she's only at the house maybe one night a week yet she's allowed to have the biggest three man room in the house and there is absolutely no consequences for her actions because the housing director and her son in law are best friends!

Mobility Rehabilitation & Home Healthcare,(352) 243-4422,ChIJ-0ZejYWO54gRe944GKWSD3o,Immy,5,"A Year of Exceptional Care: Highly Recommend This Therapy Team!
I am writing this review to express my absolute admiration and gratitude for the incredible physical, occupational, and speech therapy team that has been working with my patient for the past year. From day one, their dedication, expertise, and compassionate approach have been nothing short of exemplary.

Over the last 12 months, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the remarkable progress my patient has made, and it's largely due to the consistent, tailored, and thoughtful care provided by every therapist involved. They don't just treat symptoms; they genuinely invest in the well-being and long-term success of their patients.

What truly stands out is their holistic approach and the seamless way they integrate all three disciplines. Lindsey, the speech therapist, consistently keeps my patient on track, while Megan, the occupational therapist, skillfully motivates my stubborn patient to do his exercises. We can't forget Shawna, who tolerates his antics with remarkable patience, and Beverly, who gently encourages my patient, with her soft demeanor, to do what needs to be done during the session! Each therapist communicates effectively, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of recovery and development. Their professionalism is always evident, but it's their kindness and genuine care that truly set them apart. They foster an environment where patients feel supported, encouraged, and motivated, even on challenging days.

If you are looking for a therapy company that delivers outstanding results with genuine compassion and expertise, I wholeheartedly recommend them. Their commitment to their patients is evident in every session, and they deserve all the praise for the incredible work they do.",2025-07-29 20:01:24,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIEZGwzQwmcRzsUzJoViOp8VKGQQLA6fvLL3ZvbKAXR35YvCoJs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:13:11.892611,,

Thanks to the motor exercises and activities Ms. Kathryn has introduced, we’ve seen huge improvements. Our child’s ability to focus, follow along with instructions, and complete tasks without frustration has grown significantly.
In addition to ocular motor therapy, Ms. Kathryn specializes in integrating reflexes, which I didn’t even realize were a factor before starting therapy. These reflexes were causing issues with balance, coordination, and fine motor skills. She has significantly helped our child in integrating these reflexes and building more stability and control over his body.
The environment Ms. Kathryn creates is warm, welcoming, and child-centered. She has a natural way of connecting with children, which makes therapy feel like a fun and positive experience rather than a chore. We also appreciate how she has kept us informed and involved in the process, providing us with helpful strategies and activities to support our child’s progress at home.

Recommended me a legal aid that does not give the services she deemed I needed,
Left 2 messages, one with the front office and one with her receptionist from her department and still No call back.
It’s the incompetence of people I don’t understand, why take a new patient if that wasn’t your intentions in the first place? Why lie to people faces then avoid them entirely?
Had the nerve to tell me if I don’t answer my phone when she calls, she will cancel the case and yet I don’t get the decency to get a call back? Some people just hate their jobs and love the money. I never liked this company, and I never will. Just atrocious behavior.

.  These professional women go above and beyond to ensure I’m receiving optimum services.  They all are kind, compassionate, dedicated and hardworking.  They genuinely care for you.

*******As for the administration and the management at Multilingual well that’s a disappointment.  Recently there has been a significant change in personnel.  Some employees were there for many years and contributed in a positive manner and were let go.  It sad to see good people treated poorly.*******

Today I was made aware that I needed to pay an out of pocket cost of $20.00 for medication management.  I’ve had the same insurance since the beginning of January 1, 2025. I have been disabled since August 2022 and I have not worked since August 2022 my psychiatric, psychotherapy and case management was being covered by the brighter family foundation, which I am eternally grateful for. I’ve been in and out of the hospitals as recent as last Wednesday, August 20, 2025 in which I had surgery to cut my tendons & remove my nerves.  I suffer from degenerative spinal stenosis, which there is no no cure for each day. My mobility gets worse so much so that on June 12, I was getting out of my car and I fell over my left leg cause I couldn’t lift it out of the car and I fell flat face flat on the pavement and broke my nose. I almost passed away from sepsis infection end of 2024.  My hospital bills were over $700,000.  The majority was covered from my insurance company and the out-of-pocket cost. I was able to get billed and later request financial assistance.

"My Autism Connection, Inc. (MAC)",(239) 288-6070,ChIJ6zx5MQJA24gRHaejDNuYLaE,Maria Reimer,5,"For people on the Autism Spectrum; forming relationships and maintaining them is a challenge.
When my daughter, was originally diagnosed with Autism at age 3; one of my biggest concerns was finding groups and organizations where she could receive guidance navigating social settings. When individuals with Autism become  adults; the safe enriching environments of school or college are no longer there to serve as guides, yet life’s complex interactions remain.
When our family moved to Southwest Florida from the Midwest over 10 years ago we found My Autism Connection. To say this organization has been an integral part of my daughter’s adult life is an understatement.  The group led by Sandra Worth and her capable, caring and compassionate team help adults on the spectrum with all facets of everyday. From social activities, to in-depth discussions on Life Skills to advocating at your employment; My Autism Connection is there to assist these young adults paths. Class topics include ‘appropriate dining manners’, ‘how to behave and dress for a job interview’ and ‘things to expect and be aware of when going through security at an airport’.
The Lee County Driver’s Challenge was pivotal when my daughter was learning to drive. A mock pull over complete with sirens and how to handle a stressful situation with law enforcement was part of the day’s learning curriculum.
This group enjoys all the things we ALL look for in life; friendship, support, encouragement and most importantly stresses ongoing personal growth.
My Autism Connection is a group  that inspires their members to be hopeful but best of all PREPARED for a bright future.",2024-06-12 17:50:40,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK1KuA2eZmd6o1I8Xrd1nhRFPq6rP3-5Hlhsa7p4wN9vUWt0g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:13:22.684906,,

(MAC)",(239) 288-6070,ChIJ6zx5MQJA24gRHaejDNuYLaE,Nick L,1,"As this organization may be good for individuals in the middle to low range of the spectrum, They are not good for individuals on the higher end of the spectrum. First of all, The activities that are planned are designed purposely for that middle to low range demographic. Activities such as life skills workshops, Chaperoned Field Trips and classes on adult resonsibilies may good for someone in the lower spectrum they are little to no help to higher end individuals who already have those adult responsibilities daily. Secondly the owner of this organization Sandra Worth get too involved with your personal life. When I would miss a meeting due to work or college I would get a call the next day from her where she would interigate me to explain everything I did during that meeting time and lecture to me on how if I miss her meetings I would be ruining my future. During one of the meetings I had to leave early due to a family emergency and since everyone was buzy I just walked out. Sandra then took the initive to follow me out to me car and started scolding me in my vehicle with statements like ""What your leaving for better be important"" and ""I am so mad that your leaving like this as its looks bad for the organization"". Thirdly, For a non-profit organization their fees are atrocious. Before I left this place I was being charged 80 dollars a month for ""member-dues"" and any activities other then the 2 per month group meeting was charged extra anywhere between 40 and 120 dollars. I understand that someone needs to pay the bills but with the amount of donations this place gets these prices should be way more subsidized than this. In conclusion, I am not saying My Autism Connection is a bad organization for the people that are getting a benifit from it but what I am saying is that they should be more open to High-Functioning individuals in saying that this place might not be the best fit for them.

She does speech  therapy with Mila and occupational therapy with Susy. ( she started with Jessica ❤️ who’s also an amazing therapist)  My daughter went from not talking or using words at all to using 4 word sentences. It’s extraordinary to see your child go from no eye contact or responding to their names to speaking. The therapists took time to speak to me and explain the sessions . They helped me understand my daughter’s condition and comforted me when I felt discouraged. They helped with negative behaviors and transitions . I will forever be grateful for the dedication and time they have given my daughter . The whole staff is wonderful . It’s nice to see other therapists who don’t have my child as their patient say her name and acknowledge her. Jorge who is at the front desk is always so gracious with us parents and kind to all the children . I want to give a special thanks to Mila who has spent the most time with my daughter. She has cried with me and been there for us when things were really hard. She was there for us when my daughter got the autism diagnosis and she continues to be a light that shines bright.

My Big World Inc,(305) 388-0004,ChIJb42SjVPA2YgRL8wwFxrJ9_8,Litify Services,1,"My experience with My Big World has been extremely disappointing. Despite initially showing promise, the lack of professionalism and communication from the center has been unacceptable.

After my son's evaluation, I never received any follow-up from the center to discuss the findings or establish a care plan. Consequently, I had to take matters into my own hands, reviewing the report and scheduling sessions myself to avoid unnecessary delays.

To my dismay, I later discovered that my son had been assigned a therapist who doesn't speak English, without any prior consultation or notification. This disregard for my preferences and failure to communicate such a significant change in my son's therapy plan is inexcusable.

Despite raising my concerns weeks ago, there has been no satisfactory resolution. The fact that the center has been unable to find an alternative therapist within this time-frame speaks volumes about their inefficiency and lack of commitment to their clients' well-being.

As a result of this experience, I feel like I've been wasting both my time and money. I cannot recommend My Big World to anyone seeking professional and reliable speech therapy services. I will be taking my business elsewhere, where my concerns are taken seriously and addressed promptly.

She went from saying very few singular words to now expanding her vocabulary, combining words, and saying small phrases. Not only does she use the words that she has learned in speech but I also notice that it easier for her to imitate and use new words outside of therapy too. Staff are always so friendly and communicate everything that happened in the session. The clinic is always clean and is packed with many toys and even a playroom. I also love how the doors of the offices have little windows that let parents see their child during sessions. This helped me feel comfortable and safe in dropping her off.

The place is poorly managed, and the so-called ""clinical director"" is a prime example of what happens when you give a little man too much authority. He struts around like he's Napoleon himself—full of ego, completely disconnected from the patients, and more interested in power plays than actual care. The staff seems demoralized, and it’s no wonder... management treats them like they’re disposable. Confidentiality apparently means nothing here, with certain therapists openly discussing clients’ private matters as if it’s cocktail hour. I’ve seen better organization at a high school reunion. The only saving grace? The food is decent, and the techs aren't doing that bad. If you're considering this place for care, I’d strongly urge you to look elsewhere.

What’s more is she got visibly angry with me when i asked if there was any research published on what she was telling me to do. This person is unqualified to treat patients and i hope this place gets shut down. My medical history was taken by a very nice man who was actually an MD but i could tell he was a contractor who was beholden to Catherine’s whims. He would try to interject on my behalf and get shut down immediately by her though she didn’t listen to my history at all nor seem to care, she just wanted my money. My blood for the labs ordered were taken by a nurse in a Solaris uniform leading me to believe any actual medical professional in this establishment is a 1099 contractor trying to make some extra money on the side. They also sell pyramid scheme products on the lobby and make unrealistic claims about everything they’re doing there.

I didn’t feel peace about the surgery, I just thought there’s no way this young and healthy I should go do such an invasive procedure that has a lot of dangerous side effects  (also scared of the what ifs, if I don’t do the procedure and I’m wrong). My mom heard of this doctor hopeful and doing anything to avoid this surgery, I called to see what they said. Dr Blount was only one available to get an appointment with which turned out to be a huge blessing. my issue was time sensitive so I saw him & he listened for an hour to me, everything I had to say. Assured me that I was not crazy, the research I had done that my other doctors had never heard of, was accurate. Patient, kind, wise, knowledgeable, gentle man. He heard me and did exactly what I wanted him to do, with his guidance and recommendations and a few months later I had tests ran with a primary care doctor (who was very skeptical of whoever I went to go see as she had never heard of this working) and I’m completely healed. Clear tests. When she called to give me results she told me she looked him up after I had left her office and in fact she very impressed by his resume. I believe anywhere Dr Blount goes, I’ll follow for guidance for as long as he practices. Specifically, I would request to see him if you go here.

My first visit went ok. However, my second visit was scheduled to go over labs and a food allergy/sensitivity test performed by KBMO Diagnostics. Catherine greeted my husband and I with a steady cough wearing a mask under her chin, insisting that she was NOT contagious. She made no attempt to wear the mask on her face!  Sadly she got my husband very sick. On the way home, I called her office to verify why the KBMO test said I can eat gluten, amongst other things to which I have a strong allergic reaction. I could have ended up in the hospital! Several follow up calls and over a week later, Catherine called and left a muffled Voice message - incomprehensible. I immediately called her back, she did not answer and proceeded to text me while I was calling her, demanding that I never call her number or text her, and that if I needed my question answered I must be willing to make another appointment for another paid visit. Well don’t worry Catherine, you won’t be seeing my face again in your office, nor getting another phone call from me. I would never recommend anyone to your practice! These people are clearly incompetent at providing professional and safe patient care. I’m still waiting to have the $325.00 I paid for the KBMO test refunded. This request has been ignored. The conflicting test results could have landed me in the hospital! In summary, Catherine proved to be unprofessional, rude, uncaring, not practicing good hygiene protocol, extremely dismissive…more focused on getting more of my money, rather than providing the care I had already paid for!

I could immediately tell that Neubility  was well equipped to deal with serious brain injuries and deficits from stroke to Parkinson's disease among 0thers.
I was assigned to Dr. Zak Kimmett & Kara Eldridge for an evaluation and treatment. They paid close attention to where I was with a professional eye assessing what is needed to be done to achieve my goals. They work together seamlessly.
As a stroke survivor I understand that I will never have my old life back, but I know that Neubility, their highly trained staff and appropriate equipment and safety approach will deliver me to a level of function I could only hope for previously.

Neubility Rehabilitation and Wellness,(727) 616-0809,ChIJo-4RgSzDzkQR4bBgoVb3rTw,Joseph F Kearney,3,"My experience with Neubility  was initially very positive with Dr. Becca Canizares. Becca not only who knew how to provide physical therapy with ALS patients, but she did so with a great deal of understanding and compassion.

Unfortunately, Han Nguyen (the owner) fails to demonstrate the the same degree of compassion as Becca or the high degree that she falsely portrays to the public. For example, I missed my last appointment when I suddenly experienced an ALS related episode as I was preparing to leave my home. There was no way I could make it at the appointed time let alone do any of the physical therapy exercises. I immediately got to my bed and rested for several hours. Later that night when I woke up I found a message on my cell phone from Becca expressing concern over my well being.  Looking further down my message list, I also found a message from Han reminding me that I will now be charged an $80.00 fee for missing my appointment.There was no concern expressed about my welfare. There was, however, concern expressed about how my missed appointment affected her business, future bookings, financial impact on employees, etc.

I was more than accommodating when Becca asked me to rearrange my schedule to help her see other patients. But Han disregards this and other legitimate circumstances all in the name of business policy and an owner's financial well-being.

You may want to consider this experience before deciding on a provider.

Jen was able to diagnose my skeletal mis-alignment and posture and apply the correct fascial therapy to fix the ROOT CAUSE of the pain.  I follow with exercises to maintain the alignment.

Zephyr was struggling with issues related to a neurological condition he had since a kitten. With her care along with Dr. Morris's, Zephyr was more stable in his gait and use of the litter box. Between the drs and their wonderful caring staff - Heidi, Sabrina, and Danielle - Zephyr was at ease with his treatments and time at the center. A few months later, Zephyr was given a special nickname -- Spicy Boy - due to his big MEOW attitude. I never worried about Zephyr while he was at the holistic center as I knew those who cared for him, actually cared for him. Despite the care and affection Zephyr received from Drs. Spinosa and Morris as well as Sabrina, Danielle, and Heidi ... Zephyr passed away in early January 2022. Thank you so much for caring for and loving on my Zman. Your thoughtfulness and concern will not be forgotten. I apologize too for the delay in this review .... time has not made Zephyr's passing any easier for me perhaps with more time ..........

This has been the worst place I’ve ever dealt with — not just in terms of service, but in the complete lack of compassion and resources for our children. After waiting an entire year for an appointment, we were given only a 15-minute grace period, despite traveling a long distance from Homestead to Weston. We arrived just after that window and were refused service.

I tried to speak with multiple staff members and the office manager, asking for any flexibility — even just to be added to a waitlist — but was met with cold, robotic responses and no willingness to help. The only solution offered was to reschedule, with no regard for how long the next wait might be.

This place is beyond disappointing.

Too add, my  daughter had a lesion in her throat and the doctor said it was food. You can clearly see that it was not food but a lesion, the puss in her throat was underneath her veins.

I called today to request that the prescription be sent to the pharmacy and spoke with 2 different nurses. The first just transferred to a second one who was like a robot repeating they do not prescribe it as it can be purchased over the counter.

This place is false advertising!!! They use a tax ID associated with their hospital not an urgent care and even though they say they are an urgent care, they are billing as a hospital visit.

Been feeling with this for months now and still haven’t had any help.

They need to take their sign down that says urgent care as that is not what they are!

They are greedy and only care about money, not your children.

Check your billing… you will see.

Nicklaus Children's Palm Beach Gardens Outpatient Center,(561) 624-9188,ChIJvUXFgaMq34gRqP44egcxLpU,chris martin,1,"One star is actually to generous.

I brought my young daughter to Palm Beach Gardens outpatient center for treatment of a facial laceration. Before arriving, I specifically called the facility to confirm that a plastic surgeon would be available to perform the procedure, and I was assured that they were properly staffed. However, when we arrived, the clinic did not have anyone on site qualified to treat her. Instead, we were told to go to a neighboring hospital for care. Total waste of time.

To make matters worse, the clinic still billed me for the visit, even though they provided no actual treatment or service. I find this unacceptable — not only was my daughter’s care delayed, but I was also misled about the capabilities of the clinic and then charged for essentially a referral.  I requested detailed invoice on three occasions and was told it would take 14 days to process the request.  Of course a detailed invoice was never provided.

Families seeking timely, competent care should be aware of this experience. At the very least, the facility should be transparent about the services they are (and are not) able to provide, and they should not bill patients for treatment that never occurred.",2025-08-26 09:56:17,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIaBx1_LKglpZsnf-AjaDnGq7piJiEhdYcq1bCiK1D1MmXEfw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:13:47.545781,,

When we arrived, they immediately provided us with a private room to say our goodbyes no rush, no pressure just a quiet, respectful space to be with our dog for as long as we needed.
Every single person we encountered was kind, gentle, and empathetic. The two front office ladies were outstanding, and the veterinarian was just as compassionate and professional. It’s clear that everyone there truly cares about the animals and the families who love them.

The therapist and staff here are like family. Everything stated in his review is false. He is not even enrolled in the child's therapy that he is referring to nor the insurance the child is covered by. When you call staff at any facility speaking about things you know nothing about and demanding things and belittling the staff of course no one wants to help you because no one deserves to be treated the way he treats people. And you sir will not continue to fight with hospital staff or any physician or therapist your son sees. I will not let who you are negatively affect the care your son receives.

Dr. Morton and her Vet Tech (I apologize for not remembering her name) were not only kind to my new little puppy but very thorough about the questions they had about my pup.  The Dr. wanted to know about the current life style of my pup as well as the background of the parents.  Type of food, potty habits, etc.
Dr. Morton even took the time to show me how to properly trim my puppies nails, while she was trimming them.
Dr. Morton gave me recommendations then asked me a couple of times, if I had questions.  She would not leave the exam room until I asked everything I needed. 💕😊  Her complete focus was on me and my pup, not her next appointment.  What more could you ask for?

North Stuart Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation,(772) 692-6994,ChIJqen3Z9fn3ogRbm4qZaSnxwg,Paul Matthews,5,"My first visit to North Stuart Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation I was not in a great place, after multiple surgeries to fix my shoulder and a 4+ month rehabilitation process in my future, this was not a great time for me personally.
At the end of my first visit, I honestly felt 100% more optimistic that I would not only get through the Physical therapy process, but it was going to be both fun and effective.

North Stuart Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation is the most well-run, professional and high-quality Physical therapy facility I have ever experienced,
The operation is run with military style efficiency, yet each of the therapists is warm, friendly, professional, competent and extremely knowledgeable, I was treated like a person not a patient. Every therapist is hard-working, and they all operate as a well-coordinated team, regardless of who your therapist is that day, every one of them takes responsibility to make sure you’re following your exercise cadence correctly.
You get the feeling that each one of the team genuinely wants you to heal and quickly get back to your life after surgery

Northampton Animal Clinic,(850) 668-8031,ChIJK_mNCqtZ7IgRpNYEdMHUfds,ally sansotta,5,"I adopted my dog when he was three years old while living in another city, and he came with his fair share of pre-existing conditions that I had to learn to navigate. After a few difficult experiences with other vets (who very clearly didn’t see my dog as anything more than a dollar sign) we were panicked trying to find the right care for him when we moved to Tallahassee. Now, we are beyond thankful to have found Northampton.

I truly can’t say enough good things about this place. Every team member knows my dog by name and is thoroughly familiar with his extensive medical history. He’s had two very necessary surgeries with them, so they know we’ll do whatever it takes for his health, yet they’ve never once taken advantage of our love for him. They’re incredibly transparent when it comes to cost, always presenting every available option and never pushing anything unnecessary. They actually recommend more affordable approaches to try first whenever they can rather than defaulting to the most expensive route.

Cost aside, they truly make the entire experience personal and welcoming. When we ask our dog if he wants to go to the vet, he runs to the door in pure excitement — they’ve made the experience so positive for him that he genuinely thinks it’s a fun trip! The staff at Northampton are the warmest, most knowledgeable, and genuinely kind group I’ve ever encountered at a veterinary clinic.

My daughter will be graduating next week from high school!!! At times (especially early on) we never knew if this was a possibility or what her future would look like. Miss Rosie never doubted it, she knew my daughter's potential from day one and throughout the last   17 YEARS  has been a Godsend! Helping her navigate language, communication, comprehension and all the millions of details that goes into each part of her speech journey.
All of the ladies are wonderful at the office. We were especially blessed to have our daughter in Rosie's hands.
Miss Rosie is the heart of this office. She CARES about your child.
I was sad to see a mom missed the opportunity to meet with Miss Rosie because she was unhappy she had to wait longer than expected. All I can say is if you knew how hard she was working for your child you would wait as long as necessary.
Miss Rosie is worth the wait. Take it from a mom who knows, I promise.

I had an appointment scheduled for 1:30 for my sons evaluation for speech just to sit there 20 minutes passed his appointment time and to later be told sorry I was in a meeting. So why schedule an appointment time if you can’t even attend the child. I texted Rosemarie about no longer scheduling my child for any further appointments just to get a message back 1HOUR passed his appointment time saying she was in a meeting and sorry about the delay.

This group has been the most supportive, communicative, and accessible practice I've worked with in all these years, and it's not even close.

In particular, I'd like to say the receptionists, Ana and her colleague, are very communicative and always confirm appointments weekly by email, and are super flexible with scheduling, and answering any questions for payment, even pointing me to community resources to continue funding my therapy when I experienced changes in my insurance and income.

As for counselling, Matthew is hands-down the best that I've had the pleasure of not only working with, but getting to know as a human being. It's tangible he actually loves his job, and goes the extra mile for making sure he provides multiple avenues of support, from individual sessions, to hosting LGBT+ group circles to discuss various topics. He even assisted in trying to help me find a family therapist, so I can work on other relationships beyond our individual sessions.

She mentioned all of these tied together for mental stimulus but that’s not what we wanted. We just needed a way to get her to listen when bored and everything we were going to be taught fell into similar categories. Because of this we asked for a partial refund. This wasn’t the problem.

Asia was nice, informative, and good with our dog. Our problem was when I called because over text she wanted to see if there was a way to communicate this better, we were getting to the same situation: she was talking over me/cutting me off, saying our dog was unstable (literally both lessons we went she said she’s an easy dog to train until the call happened), and was rudely clapping on the other side when trying to get her point across. I insisted we just wanted a refund multiple times before she finally listened to me.  The call was super unprofessional where prior to that we were fine with the trainer.

Additionally, she said our refund would take a couple days to go into our account. I contacted a couple days recently asking where it was and two days later it then went in.

Off Leash K9 Training Tampa,(813) 461-6210,ChIJi9Qp9G7SwogRfUd1AhJ0BO0,M Y,5,We had an amazing experience with Estivin of OffLeash K9 training!! From the very start there was constant communication between Estivin and myself letting us know how Ranger was doing and and sending daily pictures or videos showing us what they were doing and the progress our dog was making! Sending him away for 2 weeks was a very hard decision to make but I’m so happy we did! We didn’t expect a completely different dog but the progress Estivin made with Ranger in those 2 weeks is incredible! Now it’s up to us to continue putting the work in each and every day and with the tools and resources we’ve been given I’m confident in the success of Ranger and that he’ll have a much better quality of life! 10/10 would recommend Estivin to anyone who’s looking to get more control over there dog and to build a better relationship between you and your dog!

Cosmo is 8 months now and he really does creat at obeying our commands, not getting distracted by other dogs or people and staying within the bound which we place on him. Example: when we have dinner he goes to his place and stays on command while we eat. After dinner, we allow him up on the couch with us to watch TV…he thinks he is a lap dog at 60lbs lol.  He also loves ridding in our open jeep and is always well behaved and confident around other animals  and people.  Ernie did a fantastic job with training Cosmo and us in all his commands.  Cosmo is still a puppy, and not perfect at everything, but the training made a world of difference for our family of 2 dogs and 2 cats.  Thank you Ernie!  Lena and I are very happy with your services and give you our highest recommendation to our friends and family.

We did the 2 week board and train program and we have only amazing things to say about Estivin. He gave us all the tools we need and he sent daily updates of our dogs along with pictures.

We can’t believe how lucky we are to have found Estivin! Leaving our 4-month-old puppies, Remi and Kali, for the first time was nerve-wracking. However, from the moment we met Estivin and his family, we knew they were in the best possible hands. He took the time to walk us through everything, answered all our questions, and immediately put us at ease.

During their week of boarding and training, Estivin consistently updated us with photos and videos showing the puppies’ progress. Within just two days, we were completely blown away by how much they had already learned! The foundation he laid was nothing short of incredible. We now have confident puppies who respond to basic commands like come, sit, stay, bed, and crate and we practice them daily thanks to the strong start Estivin gave us.

Perhaps the biggest change? Walks! Before training, Remi and Kali couldn’t stand wearing collars or harnesses and hated being on leash. Now, they love their walks and have amazing leash manners. It’s such a dramatic turnaround we honestly didn’t think was possible in a weeks time.

We’ve had dogs before and have done our own training successfully, but raising littermates has been a completely different and more challenging experience than we expected. Estivin’s compassion, expertise, and dedication have made all the difference.

We truly don’t know where we’d be without him. We’re so grateful for everything he’s done for our puppies, and we’re already planning to continue training around the 6-month mark.

Thank you, Estivin! You deserve all the recognition in the world! We’re excited for the next phase of training and deeply appreciate your hard work and love for what you do.

Forever grateful,

What makes the visit even more inspiring is meeting Priya Vardheesh, a passionate and dedicated woman whose love for the land is evident in every corner of the farm. She’s wholeheartedly supported by her husband, making it a powerful team effort.

Their vision for the property is to transform it into a fully grown forest in the next three years — and given the pace and purpose I saw, it’s absolutely achievable.

The staff is so so down to earth and understanding and they are all willing to help in any way possible with your recovery. I was avid hater of treatment facilities but Olympic truly won me over. It was truly like family. Even the higher ups were accessible and personable and truly a pleasure to be around. Steph and Meg truly helped me through my darkest times and helped me through some of my personal issues even in instances when they weren’t obligated to.  I could tell they really care and that this isn’t just a “job” for them. They are highly interactive with the clients and go absolutely above and beyond to make our recovery and transition easy. I was never a big fan of therapy but I had the BEST therapist. Rebecca is another person who really cares, I was so comfortable from day one talking to her and she helped me realize ALOT about myself. Easily the best therapist Ive ever had and Ive had MANY. I highly recommend her and I wish she would be my therapist for life. The housing manager Chuck and the Techs are also unsung heroes there. EVERY one of them were helpful, kind, welcoming, and accommodating. I can’t say enough good things about Brohnson. He’s really the glue that holds everybody together. Not only was he someone I consider a mentor and like an older brother to me but also a friend. He’s driven and hilarious and no matter who you are or what you’re going through he makes time to see about you. He never takes anything personally and handles every situation with a grace and poise I hope to achieve one day. Chuck does soo much behind the scenes to make our lives comfortable. He takes care of all of our housing needs and is always around if there’s an issue. He’s extremely personable and easy to talk to. I can’t say enough good things about him. I could go on and on about the amazing experiences Ive had with the techs there. KT, Tre, Amor, Jack, Carlos, Steven, I love them all. I don’t have a single bad thing to say. They all helped me immensely and never failed to drop what they were doing to come and see about me and my needs. Even my wants! Jackie my case manager helped me soooo much. She works so hard to resolve any issue we have and I never could’ve gotten to the next stage if my recovery without her! She’s so nice and all of the clients love her, me included! Erin and Sabina the nurse and the doctor respectively saw about ALL of my medical needs including needs I didn’t even know I had! They truly care and have given me advice more than once about things not even medical related. I truly feel like I can go to them about anything and they’d sit and listen. I love them to death! Finally Ryan is the man who initially got me to come to OBH and I didn’t expect for him to be such an integral part of the community. He and Crystal not only get clients to come here and get help hut check in on them and see about them every step of the way. They are always around and available to talk and even now that I’ve left the program they still check in with me and make sure I’m doing ok. I truly feel seen and cared for by clinical and the staff here and I know anybody who chooses Olympic to help them with their journey will feel the same way. It wasn’t just helpful it was fun and I will always cherish my time and family at Olympic. Thank you everybody! But especially thank you Steph, Meg, Brohnson, Rebecca, and Ryan for seeing me through.

From the staff that clients deal with everyday, the facilitators and therapists, all the way to the top, I received nothing but love! They also never once gave up on me and my journey. What’s more impressive is that I definitely did not make it easy to stick by my side and yet they did anyway. Very comfortable housing and accommodations, fun outings multiple times a week and in depth, meaningful groups make this program thrive but I have to say my favorite part of the whole experience is the camaraderie within the community. There is very little divide between management, alumni and current clients and it creates a great space for continued care. Once you join this family you’re always a part of this family!

All of the staff come to work each and every day with your best interests at heart! The Director of Operations has an open door policy, and unlike some places she welcomes you in and makes you feel heard!

The therapists, facilitators, case managers, alumni coordinators, technicians, nurses, and all other support staff are wonderful! They go out of their way to see you succeed and recover.

I decided to sign up with this trainer not only because of his reviews but because he had his own gym and was affordable.  HE IS WELL WORTH IT!  I have appreciated my training sessions with him so much.

When I say I HATE WORKING OUT, it is the truth!  But with him, it actually feels like I am leveling up like a video game character, lol.  In just a matter of 3 weeks, my endurance has exceeded my expectations.   Also as a female, I feel that he is highly respectful as a male trainer.  I have had trainers in the past that were male and it never felt quite right, with him, there are never any concerns and he is always appropiate when he helps you with weights or gives you a hand to get back up after a killer workout.

I didn't expect to find him but I am glad I did.  He has an extensive background in physical therapy, so not only are you training but he informs you with fact driven knowledge in the industry.  He creates blogs that keep you up to date with current health trends as well.  He is passionate about what he does and it shows!  I've attached a snippet from one of our workouts!

Her care, professionalism, and sports-specific expertise were exceptional from start to finish.
Even with my own clinical background, I knew my son needed someone who could connect with him as an athlete— not just manage the injury. Hannah did exactly that. She built a thoughtful, challenging, and individualized rehab plan that kept him motivated, focused, and progressing safely. Her ability to push him while keeping the process positive and fun was such a gift.
Watching my son, regain his strength, confidence, and passion for the game ( after being out for 9 months) was incredibly meaningful- and I have Hannah to thank for guiding him through it.

There were days when I was brought to the back, and given one exercise while the staff went to help other patients in different rooms. When I finished my exercise, I'd be left sitting there waiting for what came next. After waiting for a while, someone would come out of a room, say,  ""Hey Brittany, all good? That's it for today."" and I'd be sent to the front to schedule the next appt. I'd get less than 10 minutes of treatment. They seemed more concerned with car accident patients with attourneys while I was using insurance. There were 2 visits where the PT working with me was on the phone with someone discussing his car the whole time not paying me any attention for the first 10 minutes, then would say he had to go and that someone would be with me soon. He'd grab his bag and run out the door and I'd just be sitting there for the next 20 minutes until the Dr came out of the room and said ""Hey Brittany, that's it for today."" and send me to the desk. Of the maybe 7 visits I attended, only 2 of them were actually productive. I really wanted this to work out but unfortunately, in my time of need for relief and treatment, I was left feeling like I wasn't as important as their other patients.

I have consulted and been treated by Dr. Brandon for two separate issues and was blown away by his expertise and ability to “fix” me.  My first issue was mobility and pain in my shoulder (the arm I carry my kids with). After ignoring a small pain and decreased range of motion, until it was excruciating and debilitating, Dr. Brandon not only treated me but gave me a plan of movements to do at home. After about 3 weeks my shoulder was completely pain free and my range of motion improved tremendously to allow me the ability to perform movements I had never been able to achieve. Fast forward to a year later when I injured my knee. The level of pain in my knee was so severe that I was not able to sleep at night or bend at a 90 degree angle. After seeing an acupuncturist and  massage therapist with no improvements, I was about to see an orthopedic surgeon but I wanted to try Brandon before potentially having surgery. After about 6 months of PT with Dr. Brandon,  my knee is fully healed! I am able to walk, run and lift weights again. Dr. Brandon is incredible and full of knowledge. Aside from healing, Dr. Brandon will get to the root of your injury and give you the tools to keep your body in optimal health.

Dr Brandon is both a Dr of physical therapy and a licensed strength and conditioning instructor. At our first appointment he performed an FMS (Functional Movement Screen) with our son to get a full assessment of his current strengthens and weaknesses. This is so incredibly important to building a personal strength and conditioning plan. All of Dr Brandon's programming is customized based my son's individual needs, it's not a ""one size fits all"" program and that's been the key to his dramatic gains. Dr Brandon trains holistically.

I've had shoulder issues for several years and after multiple attempts via the VA, physical therapy, cortisone shots and other ideas that didn't work out right, I reached out to Brandon.

I've been seeing him for 4 weeks and during that time I've had major improvements in not only my shoulder, but in my overall mobility. I've made some large gains the last several weeks working out and some great results while golfing as well. I went from not being able to use my shoulder to much greater improved mobility.

He does a great job of explaining in great detail what I need to do and makes sure I have it down prior to me leaving our sessions. He's easily reachable with questions and even provided me a detailed plan for making sure I get everything in when I need to.

Go see him. He'll take great care of you.

Orlando Neuro Therapy - Physical Therapy,(407) 900-0841,ChIJMWSooG5l54gR28L-c8Z8It0,Abha Saraswat,5,"Dr. Tara has been an AMAZING therapist for my dad. He suffered from a very severe stroke at the end of August, and for almost a month afterward he was unable to move his right side. After being discharged from acute rehab he regained some mobility, but had a long road ahead. Not being satisfied with outpatient therapy only 2x per week, I looked for ways to supplement his therapy, which is how I found Dr. Tara.
I'm so grateful that she offers a way to receive high quality physical therapy for patients who have suffered from strokes.
Dr. Tara is extremely knowledgable, professional, and dedicated to her patients. You can tell that she really cares about her patients, and has the expertise to help them get better.
In the few weeks since my dad has started therapy with Dr. Tara, I have noticed a big difference in his strength and mobility. His ability to stand up on his own has gotten stronger, he is able to walk (assisted) for longer distances, and his range of motion has improved. I""m excited about his future progress in the weeks ahead! I plan on having my dad work with Dr. Tara for as long as we live in this area because I know that his progress will jump by leaps and bounds with her help.",2019-12-20 07:54:49,5 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocId-ZoxM0mDkY3OLfEekWJ-if-JHafLy_DJQXZ6yhavjfr1Bg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:14:24.905979,,

We had discovered her online and found her videos so exceptionally helpful that we had to see her in person.  It is one of the best decisions we have made regarding therapy and recovery.
My husband, Sheldon, had a massive stroke almost 4 years ago, was able to walk short distances with a hemi walker but had virtually no movement with his left arm.  After just a couple sessions, Tara, was able to encourage Sheldon to walk without an assistive device—merely with her guided touch and coaching.  Seriously!!  It turns out he was replacing his affected leg with the hemi-walker and not really progressing his walking.  With a smaller footprint, he now walks daily at home without any assistive device (my guidance) and is transitioning to a hiking stick with the goal to actually walk on his own.  We could not believe this was even possible before working with Tara and learning his underlying issues.
Working with his affected arm, Dr. Tobias was able to get Sheldon to mentally connect to his arm and manage some movement.  Sheldon has spasticity and the stretching component and working with her to get extension has been amazing.  Again, Tara provides a clarity of understanding and solid tangible solutions.  She has even left us with a tailored home program.
Tara’s talent as a diagnostician is superior to all prior therapists and neurologists we have worked with.  She provides insightful observations and exercises that progress your goals.  You will amaze yourself as to what you can accomplish.  Tara has a positivity that is enhanced by her skills, knowledge and experience engendering trust and confidence.  To say our experience was thrilling is an understatement.  Sheldon’s achievements and growth are inspirational and will bring him to a new level.

Upon discharge my doctor stressed the importance of starting my physical therapy as soon as possible. When I called to set up my initial assessment. I was given a date of 1 month out. I was scared and felt like I needed to start my rehabilitation sooner than that. My wife went on line and found Tara who specializes in neuro-physical therapy. She agreed to see us immediatly for evaluation.

Her office is clean and very welcoming. One of the main advantages of Tara over other physical therapists is that she talks in the same language that my doctors were speaking in. This helped me feel like everyone was on the same page for my treatment plan.

Not only did Tara help me with the problem I came in with, it was her that told me that I didn’t need her anymore. She instructed me on how I could continue my rehab at home.

The last thing you need to know about Tara is, she’s a happy person. Someone with a genuine smile. She will be the highlight of your day as you walk an uncertain future if you’re dealing with nerve damage.

The previous crematory I've used in the past closed due to the owner retiring and their lengthy renovations. I've conducted my research for my current needs.  I found Orlando Pet Crematory and read the reviews based on their high score.  I didn't know what to expect as far as appearance since they are located within an industrial area.  I was truly surprised!  They have a cozy waiting room, offices and a conference room where I sat with Kevin to discuss my 14 year old cat, Kiki's remains. He took his time and explained the process: fur clippings, paw print and certificate, and showed me the urn Kiki will be coming home in, a lovely white with grey marbling with a large cat paw on the cover.  Classy touch comparing the generic plastic white container that I gotten from other facilities.  He took my specific fur clipping request:  Kiki had a raccoon-like tail. Kevin drew up the contract. The price is very reasonable and competitive compared to my past experiences; I have cremated several cats at several different places. I asked if I could pick her up the next day, perhaps, the same time.  He said, yes.  I talked about her as a loving furbaby parent would.  He said, they are like family to us.  Kiki was ready to come home the next day.  When I came in, I was greeted by the owner, Janene.  Such a warm and caring person! She presented me with a small brown shopping bag and went over Kiki's contents and how to open urn if I wanted to transfer ashes. If I had a problem, to come back and they will open it for me. I received the certificate, paw print and Kiki's clippings.  I felt a great sense of comfort as we discussed our pets and what they mean to us.  It was a pleasant experience.  They have a nice selection of urns and the prices are reasonable.  Kiki was treated with respect and dignity.  I am very satisfied with how she was handled and the professionalism and friendship both demonstrated to me.  I truly recommend Orlando Pet Crematory.

After explaining the several red flags to Grbac for which I feared having my daughter visit her mother without supervision. Grbac not only two-sided my worries, but also provided her mother’s attorney with a letter which made me seem like an angry, jealous, non-Cooperative parent. The letter stated that I didn’t “want” my daughter to visit with her mom. Grbac always found a way to explain how a person who jailed another with false accusations was misunderstood, how a person who consistently and maliciously lied may have done it simply and innocently seeking “more time” with her daughter. Well this past Jan 28th I received frantic messages and calls from my daughter requesting to be “rescued”, that she no longer wanted to endure the constant attacks, interrogations, verbal abuses and more from her mother. The mother who drove her from Miami at over 90mph for having requested to be rescued, the mother who yelled at her week in and week out for no reason, the mother who constantly told her that I was an abuser, the same that had a continuous pressure campaign for my daughter to request for more time with her mother.

They are blatantly taking advantage of pet owners and have zero accountability. My dog has chronic gum disease and has been on and off antibiotics and steroids for years. About five months ago, they convinced me—again—that she needed more teeth pulled (this would’ve been the seventh time), and charged me over $700 for the procedure. Then, after taking her in, they suddenly decided they couldn’t go through with it because her X-ray showed ""too much bone loss."" Did I get a refund? Not a single penny.

But it gets worse. Now they refuse to refill her chronic meds because they fired the last vet (who was incompetent anyway), and the new vet apparently can’t review her medical files. Their solution? Charge me again for another visit. How is that my fault? Maybe they’d have some continuity if they could actually keep a vet on staff for more than a few months.

And remember that $700 ""X-ray""? Yeah—they conveniently lost it. So now I have no proof that it was ever even taken. This place is a joke and a scam rolled into one.

She was in pain and could not use her back left leg, that’s when I found Ortho Paws on google and the amazing work they do.
The initial consultation was incredible, they took over an hour to chat to us and really talk about what they thought would work. That’s also when the cast was taken of the damaged leg.
Then a week later we went back for the fitting, again no rushing and all the time in the world to show me how the brace works and how it should be put on.
It’s been 2 weeks now and Jade is doing so well with her brace, she lies down when I want to put it in and she knows the brace means a walk. A walk with no pain! For the most part Jade has adjusted to her brace and really seems to know she can make use of that leg now.

Nola’s journey has been heartbreaking and inspiring. She was rescued in early 2024 after spending her entire life chained to a tree, bearing scars around her neck and missing all her teeth from years of gnawing for freedom. Even worse, she was missing her hind ankle from what a vet confirmed was an act of cruelty. Malnourished and heartworm positive, she was finally set free by a homeless man living in an abandoned house before we were able to bring her to safety.

After months of care and healing at Big Dog Ranch Rescue, Nola was finally ready for the next chapter – learning to walk again and live the full, active life she deserves. OrthoPaws was the only prosthetic company willing to take on her complicated case. From the start, their team has been a godsend. They created a custom prosthetic – now lovingly called “The Nola” – and have gone above and beyond, visiting the ranch personally to cast, fit, and adjust her device, checking in constantly, and truly becoming part of Nola’s journey.

Thanks to OrthoPaws, Nola is taking confident steps into her new life. Their dedication, compassion, and expertise have meant the world to us. We are forever grateful for their partnership and recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone looking to give an animal the gift of mobility and freedom.

The doc basically told me he couldn't do anything for me because I didn't want an injection, even conceding that I didn't really need one anyway but if I change my mind to come back and see him... I definitely got the vibe that they go through volume vs quality and try to sell as many injections as possible.

Trinity is always so kind and welcoming when I arrive for appointments as well.  She always makes sure I am comfortable before my session starts.

My only displeasure- the therapists sometimes see two and three patients at the same time. I'm sure it's manageable for them, but for the patients being seen… it doesn't feel as engaging or beneficial. Not when the therapist only spends maybe a couple minutes at a time with you before running off to the other patients; their full attention is never set in one place.

Two car accidents in 2016 left me with lifelong pain and, despite significant physical therapy thereafter,  no place I went to exhibited the level of care and expertise as PT Solutions.

I was wowed that they had already reviewed MRIs and other medical records in between my visits and not only explained the results better than my physicians, but tailored my physical therapy based on the information they received and adjusted the therapy as I made progress. Due to my schedule I alternated between two PTs and they were both documenting my therapy, results, and consistently communicating with one another so that each appointment addressed specific needs.

I walked into PT Solutions of Carrollwood in extreme pain; unable to even lift a coffee mug to my face and four months later I feel like dancing. I also had the pleasure of seeing their other patients improve from one appointment to the next.

The combination of being heard, having highly educated PTs, who valued my progress to get healthier, has been a god send physically and emotionally. No better experience than feeling like a hypochondriac and having a professional point out exactly why I was dealing with terrible symptoms of spine injuries and nerve issues in arms and legs too.

Dr Sam excelled at understanding what my issues were then developed a PT plan.  She is a compassionate person who coached and encouraged me to perform the exercise correctly.  She explained what I should feel with certain muscles during the exercise and when I didn't perform the exercise correctly, Dr Sam took the time to educate me how to perform it correctly for maximum benefit.  Prior to surgery I tried 2 different PT facilities and was extremely disappointed with the patient interaction.

I feel so lucky to have chosen PT Solutions of Clearwater for my physical therapy. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed by Jackie at the front desk. She has an infectious smile, is always friendly and professional, and truly makes you feel at home right away.

My physical therapist, Dr. Aly has been amazing. The treatment has already made a noticeable difference—I’ve felt better after just two visits, and I’m genuinely excited to continue my sessions. Dr. Aly is friendly, patient-focused, and clearly very knowledgeable and confident in her work.

PT Solutions of Lakeland - Christina Lake,(863) 210-5002,ChIJIWpA90o73YgRGlYZKaRfMs8,Tana,5,"I began physical therapy here in August of last year. Initially, I contacted several locations to ensure they had experience with hEDS and could provide appropriate treatment, given that it is a less common condition. I was fortunate to speak with Andrew, who kindly agreed to oversee my care and support my recovery from surgery, with attention to gentle treatment and listening to my needs for breaks.

In November, I needed to pause my therapy temporarily due to some healing challenges. Once I received clearance to resume, I was met with a warm and welcoming team. They consistently listened to my concerns and gently reminded me to take breaks when I needed them, helping me avoid further stress or injury while still encouraging me to regain my strength.

Every day at PT is a positive experience; the physical therapists genuinely make you feel welcomed and appreciated, always attentive and caring. The front desk staff is also outstanding, going out of their way to assist. I truly appreciate everyone’s kindness and dedication. It will be bittersweet once my treatment concludes, as I’ve had such a wonderful experience with everyone there.

I had went to another provider for 9 weeks after a partial knee replacement, without getting the results my doctor required and the recovery needed. I was in a bad place both physically and mentally, feeling hopeless after almost 4 months since my knee surgery. Heather at PT solutions has already proven to be the Angel I was praying for! In my very first full session with her, she had me doing a full rotation on the bike, something I had been trying to do for months. She is the most knowledgeable and caring therapist I've ever had. She doesn't leave you on your own either when completing exercises. She also has assistants who monitor you as well. She even has me come in early prior to my appointment time, just so she can put moist warm heat on my knee and other things so to get me to move at my greatest potential.  I appreciate everything Heather and the staff are doing for me! She has given me back my confidence so much that I know I can do this now, along with her help and support!

PT Solutions of Palm Coast,(386) 597-1927,ChIJHyiJJ-WV5ogRQbQOyUROvyw,Caitlyn Levy,4,"Great Team, But Ultimately Not My Fit

I want to start by saying that the physical therapy staff at PT Solutions has been phenomenal. Every interaction with the clinicians was kind, professional, and genuinely supportive—even when my condition was unfamiliar or complex, they showed patience and a willingness to learn and adapt. As someone managing a layered medical disorder, that kind of empathy means the world.

Unfortunately, what ultimately led me to seek care elsewhere was my experience with the front office. I came in as a self-driven patient with my documentation already prepared and simply asked for a printed copy of my medical records for personal tracking. The refusal to accommodate that small but meaningful request made me question whether my broader access needs would be respected long-term.

For those of us with complex health journeys, small administrative choices can have big emotional and practical consequences. Feeling supported shouldn’t stop at the treatment table—it needs to be reflected at every level of care.

That being said: Michael, you’re an incredible physical therapist, and it’s a real shame I wasn’t able to continue working with you due to shifting needs.

I’ve been a loyal patient of  Westchase Physical Therapy for over ten years.

The owner hand-picked therapists (Alex, Cynthia, Chaz, Makayla, among many others) that are friendly and genuinely care, making the time spent there enjoyable, like hanging out with friends.  And each therapist handled only two patients per hour.  Then they got bought out.  Today I call to ask a question only to find that the self pay fee literally doubled.  I'm so incredibly disappointed, as I just can't afford to pay that much, but still need therapy.  I hope they can get it worked out.

I truly appreciated her efforts and her awesome attitude.  I just wish this company was more like other clinics I had visited.  By that, I wish they didn't have such a 'hardcore' policy of collecting payment PRIOR to treatment, rather than waiting for the insurance company to process the claim.  This resulted in me overpaying ~$50 on my first evaluation visit, and then waiting 8 weeks for a refund.  Also, it was a bit sad they could not provide therapy one time due to a slight delay with my insurance extension - unless I prepaid the FULL out-of-pocket cost without hopes of a refund when the situation resolved the following day.  This experience cause me to feel like they are distrustful and very inflexible, especially considering they owed me a refund at the time. I also knock a star off because they failed to contact me when an appointment was cancelled.  Apparently the main office had an incorrect phone number listed for me in their database.  I believe the local clinic had my correct number?  Seems like I could have been reached, if effort was applied?

There was only 1 person there. I had to wait a good 15 minutes until a therapist finally showed up. Not his fault; he's a good therapist. It's management. My favorite therapists were not there. No one called to tell me they were canceling. They said my favorite therapists had put in too many hours for the week. Again, no one called to reschedule my appointment. The place is a ghost town now. I have no idea what the status of my next scheduled visits are: this week tomorrow and Friday. I only get a certain number of visits on my insurance policy.

Palm Beach Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation,(561) 408-3836,ChIJZ33bpTop2YgRsLO5YBBtcCE,J Boaz,5,"Dr. Joshua D. Bello has proven to be a true professional. He’s friendly and attentive. I certainly recommend him and his services. In the past, I normally would not have selected a chiropractor for pain and joint pain treatment, primarily because as a passenger, during a past auto accident and severe collision, I not only suffered several injuries but I vividly remember the horrific pain, and sounds of cracking of my joints and bones. So, I was very reluctant to be subjected to chiropractic therapy and manipulation wherein I’d be reminded of those sounds and pains.

Since mentioning this fear to Dr. Bello, he’s been very accommodating, and the treatment plan and the use of the very comfortable Hydromassage bed, the Mechanical traction and Hand held massager have been very comfortable and effective without the bothersome cracking sounds. My neck, shoulder, back and sciatica pain have been reduced significantly. I have a little ways to go, but I strongly believe Dr. Bello meets his “core values” that the patient ‘leaves his facility in a pain-free condition and returns to the normalcy of day to day activities without any discomfort.’",2025-04-29 04:53:30,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXWpEXGwbqnP5zpdz46tA3x7qupPD3Q9wevAnv7gzosEgpkMvk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:15:05.935131,,

If you value the well-being of your loved ones, avoid Palmetto Subacute Care Center at all costs. My mother’s experience here was a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share the horrifying negligence she suffered.

My mother was admitted to this facility after a serious health ordeal. Right from the start, I had concerns about the quality of care, and unfortunately, my worst fears were confirmed. Despite my complaints to the administration, they repeatedly failed to provide basic patient care. One morning, I discovered that they had left my elderly mother soaked in urine all night, completely neglected.

But the nightmare didn’t end there. When I visited my mom later that day, she looked extremely pale and weak. Her caregiver informed me that she had been complaining of chest pain all day, but the staff ignored it, dismissing her symptoms because her vitals appeared “fine.” While trying to cheer her up by putting on her makeup, she suddenly became unresponsive—completely lifeless. No pulse, no reaction. I panicked and ran to get the nurse, who casually took her time to respond and arrived without any medical equipment. For several agonizing minutes, my mother remained unresponsive while the nurse struggled without the necessary tools.

When my mother finally came to, she was in severe pain, clutching her chest and struggling to breathe. Despite this, the staff refused to call 911, insisting they needed a doctor’s approval. I couldn’t believe their disregard for her life. I had to take matters into my own hands and call 911 myself.

The paramedics arrived and took my mother to Jackson South in Doral, where they conducted tests but didn’t have a neurosurgeon on-site. They transferred her by ambulance to Kendall Hospital, where they finally confirmed she had a pulmonary embolism—a life-threatening condition. If I hadn’t been there to advocate for her, my mother would have died under their so-called “care.”

This facility failed my mother in every way possible. They neglected her basic hygiene, ignored her life-threatening symptoms, dismissed my concerns, and showed a complete lack of urgency even in a medical emergency. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Palmetto Subacute Care Center to anyone who values the safety and dignity of their loved ones.",2025-05-19 19:22:34,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJZuSmomCRnqzucsgDYlQR_ZpyEYM1gzMQ5BNfBFfc3SSHH9w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:15:13.571125,,

My mother had a very invasive surgery, and was in ICU for 8 days. At the hospital she was mobile walking to the bathroom with assistance, and walking in the hallways with the Physical therapists. The doctor said she would benefit from some physical therapy rehab to get stronger. The moment she got to Palmetto subacute Rehab they put a diaper on her and told her she had to do her necessities I the diaper, not to get out of bed. I told the nurse that she's ok to walk to the bathroom with assistance, I was told the following day physical therapy was going to accessed her and decide her limitations. The next day, Saturday,  she was access by physical therapy, and was told she will start her one hour therapy on Monday.  She still was wearing a diaper, and was still bed ridden. even for her meals she was in bed not even taken to a dinning room or not even able to sit in a chair. this is a very humiliating situation for a person that was very active, and even driving before the surgery. How can she get better, thrown in a bed for 23 hours and only one hour physical therapy. After 24 hrs. I signed my mom out AMA.

She is not only a highly skilled and knowledgeable speech pathologist, but also incredibly compassionate and dedicated to her students. What makes her stand out are the effective techniques and personalized strategies she uses, which are tailored to each child’s needs.

For our son, her customized approach has led to tremendous progress. He has reached important milestones in his speech that we once thought would take much longer. Over time, we have seen his confidence grow, his reading skills improve, and his ability to hold conversations become more natural and meaningful. The impact of speech therapy with Mrs. Paloma has gone far beyond just words. It has helped him thrive in school and in everyday life.

Another wonderful aspect of her service is her flexibility and commitment. She traveled to our son’s school twice a week to provide his sessions, which was an incredible help to us as working parents. That extra effort made the process so much smoother and ensured our son received consistent support.

Overall, our experience has been nothing short of amazing.

Papa Chiropractic - Port St. Lucie,(772) 337-1300,ChIJBdAJx87o3ogRyEg4R9xm5VY,Alex Kusen,2,"I was not a fan of this office.  I walked into the office and there were a few people in a large room talking very loudly and unprofessionally. The person who was working on me brought me in a room and left the door open to the large room where everyone else was. I stated that I had never been to a chiropractor before and instead of walking me through everything, he just asked a bunch of questions and told me to get on the table and just started to crack my back. I was very nervous, and the atmosphere did not help.  Then he started to use a muscle massager (pretty sure it's the same one I have at home), and he stops and goes, oh I'm sorry it just died... After that he brought me into the large open room and put a muscle stimulator device on me and left me there, he did check on me once or twice. It was all just very awkward and uncomfortable. I had a lot of anxiety since this was my first time at a chiropractor so the last thing I wanted was to be left on my own in a room with other people. At the end of my appointment the chiropractor told me he would like to see me for more follow up appointments and I asked him what the plan is, and he said he would just do the same thing we just did. Absolutely not. Maybe this is an environment that some people are looking for, but I like privacy when it comes to my health. The receptionist department is the only reason I would leave more than one star for this visit, as they were very friendly and professional.",2024-11-05 12:41:01,11 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI2I9MWoNsZPqMIPcv0cIUOKZiAh5g4P538FiMyyaJpWmu6PKI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:15:15.877562,,

This is a short and to the point experiental review of Pasadena Pet Motel.
In this context, I stopped by said business
to find out if there were any Pet Care position openings. My first visit to said business was fairly decent including staff explaining to me that I would have to speak with Mgr. Sara in order to find out. Unfortunately, I don't recall ver batum as to whether I left my name & contact info in addition to obtaining said Mgr.'s card. Regardless, I didn't hear back from said Mgr., Therefore, I decided to stop by said business for a second time. This time, I made contact with a fairly young caucasian female with  glasses who wasn't Mgr. Sara, but in a rather vague & evasive manner explained to me that said business had no position openings.
In closing, I left said business with an uncomfortable feeling as if said female  had just lied to me in regard to any Pet Care position openings for some unknown reason(s).
