"""Play Strong Kids""- Building Resilience and Ending Behavioral and Emotional Challenges in Children",(727) 222-5667,ChIJ99MNrsKRwogRzPAvIbk0gLE,Leonardo Perez del Burgo,5,"We participated in the parent-led CPRT (Child-Parent Relationship Therapy) with Dr. Jen, and it was truly eye-opening. She gave us practical tools that helped us build a deeper connection with our child and strengthen our overall relationship as a family. The structure of the weekly sessions led to a real paradigm shift in how we understand our child’s emotions and thought processes.

Even after completing the program, we've continued our individual special playtime sessions—and they’ve made a lasting impact. Our bond with our children has grown stronger, and communication has improved significantly.

We are so grateful to Dr. Jen for her guidance, insight, and support. We highly recommend her to any parent looking to build a more connected, empathetic, and joyful relationship with their child.",2025-09-22 22:11:22,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUXPgulXtrQ9gj9z36b6XtaHMQh8k7DqmGBICyUiB_KtOkpccLV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 17:57:44.835320,,

Our favorite things were:

- Each week, Dr. Jen’s feedback was specific, personalized and tailored to our family and child’s goals
- Dr. Jen’s utmost respect for children, their concerns and their feelings made this program really special. We felt our child had a behind-the-scenes ally and advocate.
- The virtual structure of the program (online meetings, prerecorded lessons) made it accessible so both parents could participate. Play time could be scheduled at home.
- We saw a weight lift off our child throughout the 10 weeks. They are more exited to connect, to express themselves and to play.

"""Play Strong Kids""- Building Resilience and Ending Behavioral and Emotional Challenges in Children",(727) 222-5667,ChIJ99MNrsKRwogRzPAvIbk0gLE,Bobby U Photography,5,"Bringing home our newborn last May was a joyful time, but it also introduced some major challenges with our toddler. He became hostile toward my wife and the baby, extremely defiant, and had frequent, explosive meltdowns. Every day felt like a battle, and after trying several other methods with little success, we felt completely helpless and defeated. That’s when we reached out to Dr. Jen for a consultation—and we are SO glad we did!

Dr. Jen introduced us to her virtual, parent-driven CPRT course, and it was truly a game-changer. She helped us understand what our toddler was going through mentally and emotionally, shifting our entire perspective on how to support him. Through her guidance, we learned how to conduct “special play times” and received incredibly thoughtful, specific feedback that helped us refine even the most nuanced aspects of our interactions with him.

Beyond the structured lessons, Dr. Jen took the time to dive deep into our specific struggles, offering detailed, actionable advice that made a real difference. She never made us feel rushed, and her thorough, compassionate approach made every session valuable. On top of that, she’s an absolute pleasure to work with—supportive, engaging, and full of warmth. We even shared plenty of laughs along the way!

Thanks to Dr. Jen, our home life has completely transformed. If you’re struggling with a challenging toddler, we can’t recommend her enough. She gave us the tools, knowledge, and confidence to navigate this season of parenting with so much more understanding and positivity.",2025-03-01 06:03:08,7 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXzIY1ozPRROf20h0NRVApNnpvG6c8e1XWmJ3fKWih47_NvW1s=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 17:57:44.835320,,

We reached out to her for a consultation and quickly realized she was the perfect person to help. Dr. Jen is very thorough and compassionate at what she does.

We are very proud that our toddler gave up his aggressive behavior in such a short time and also learned some amazing behavioral “hacks” as well as how to frame dialogue to build strong and confident children. We would encourage anyone having difficulty with a struggling child to reach out to Dr. Jen for a consult and see if she can assist!

They do not care to help you at all, all smoke and mirrors with gimmicks and DO NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE SPINE. She did zero adjustment, told me I didn’t feel it or hear it but that she did adjust me. She talked down to me like I don’t know my body or what a chiropractor is supposed to do. I have been going to a chiropractor every week sometimes 3 times a week for the last 32 years, all over the nation, this is hands down the worst service I’ve ever seen and was very much made to feel like I was an inconvenience when I was trying to tell her what my body needed, so I chose not to be seen a second time. She still charged me full price after she said she wouldn’t, and I had my friend on the phone the whole time just to monitor how I acted cause I sometimes have issues with confrontation, and my friend was cussing up one side and down the other when she heard how this lady spoke down to me as if I was a 3 year old who doesn’t understand my body. So I will be fighting for my 40 dollars back just out of general principle. I would’ve gladly paid the 25 for the cancellation within 24 hours, but she wasted 94 seconds on me and charged me full price. If you’re looking for people to suck you in and keep charging you money, this is your place, but if you want help with your body, go almost anywhere else.

My son, who is on the spectrum, has grown so much in the year we have been in 3 C's. He LOVES going to the sessions, it is one of the highlights of his week. He gets to connect with other incredible kids like himself, be guided by the most caring therapists, play games, and feel supported and empowered. He feels loved and accepted there - how I wish he felt everywhere! Chrissy cares about each and every child AND family and it shows. Her (beautiful!) practice is truly a place of love and hope, where kids are appreciated for who they are, encouraged to love who they are, while also taught skills they need to thrive in the world. I only wish that every kid who need social skills had access to a practice as wonderful as 3C's!

***I also wanted to mention that we first came to 3Cs when my son had just been diagnosed (at 5 years old, 3 years before we started sessions) and at that point he was not ready for groups. She recommended OT (which helped him immensely) and individual therapy. At that point I was a dissapointed because I really wanted to give my son all opportunities. However, as soon as he was ready for groups, Chrissy happily took him in. I realize now that it was the best timing because he would not have been ready before and now he is and can gain the most from the therapy (and your investment). My advice to parents on the waitlist or whose children are evaluated but are not ready for groups is to reach back out to 3c's because when they are ready, it will truly make a difference.",2024-08-25 11:00:21,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK0sKKdTOw_J9nsTURHyxAIJr1fq3G4YuXKhC4SL9uYfut5tw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 17:57:46.020420,,

Definitely something I will consider looking into after having tried many other types of treatments.

Update following my consultation.  The consultation went well and I scheduled another appointment for the treatment to begin the next week and I made my first installment payment.  After I gave it more thought that evening, I decided to cancel my appointment and I called the next day to cancel. I had to leave a message-no return call that day.  Some of my concerns for canceling which I shared with Dr Michelle was the cost being almost twice as much as what we were told at the dinner, that I wanted to explore other options that would be covered by insurance which EMDR is not covered, I also wanted to talk with my priest and my PCP before starting EMDR.
She said that because of handling fees they would not refund my credit card but she could write me a check.  I agreed and said I would stop in to get the check which took over a week before she had it ready for me to pick up!  It was not for the amount I paid.  It was almost $500 less!  She said that was because Dr Garcia had spent 3 hours discussing my plan with the therapist he had chosen for me.  My first treatment was scheduled with Dr Garcia since this other therapist was going on vacation that week so I’m not exactly sure what they were discussing for 3 hours!  I also had to leave messages and wait for calls to be returned, I also waited in a poorly lit waiting area with no one at the desk to greet me both times that I visited the office.

I used to go to Belcher animal clinic and when Saint John retired the new practice literally was price gouging. I had very sick kitties and brought them here and they not only charged a reasonable price but they also treated my babies as if my cats are theirs. The love and comfort they showed them was amazing. My one cat who hates everyone was purring even when they were checking a cyst on his paw. I have now recommended family and friends to go here and they are just as happy. Best vet and staff ever!!!!

"A Time To Change Counseling Center, P.A.",(850) 926-1900,ChIJq0wcdYhf7IgRnj3HZP7j5SY,Anonymous User,1,"Our experience with A Time to Change Counseling Center has been nothing short of appalling. From the moment we began as brand new clients, we were met with repeated last-minute cancellations — often just an hour before our scheduled sessions — with no regard for the fact that we had rearranged our work schedules and mental health needs around these appointments.

The communication from reception was unprofessional and dismissive, and the Operations Director demonstrated no accountability whatsoever, instead making excuse after excuse for their poor performance. At no point did we feel that our time, needs, or well-being were respected.

Even more troubling, one of their counselors made extraordinary claims about holding multiple PhDs. Given the lack of professionalism and credibility in every other aspect of this practice, I have serious doubts about the truthfulness of these claims — which raises serious questions about their qualifications and the legality of their practice.

This is not just bad business — it’s unethical and potentially dangerous. Mental health clients often come here at their most vulnerable, and this clinic’s careless, disrespectful approach only causes more harm. We are reporting this business and encourage others to do so as well to: Florida Department of Health – Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA), Florida Board of Clinical Social Work, Marriage & Family Therapy, and Mental Health Counseling , American Counseling Association (ACA) – Ethics Complaint, and the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

My girlfriend, my best friend, and I all had one shared reaction as we finished: that was an epic trail ride.

We rode with A&A Adventure Horse Trail Rides through Robbins Preserve in Davie, FL. I rode a fantastic horse named Buck a Roo, what a ride! The group was about 6 to 7 riders total, and even with a small delay due to the weather, the owner and his team handled everything like pros. They made sure we were comfortable, even tossing in extra time once the skies cleared.

The owner, whose name unfortunately slipped my mind, was incredibly professional and clearly an expert with both his horses and teaching. He gave each of us individual attention and solid instruction, which made the ride feel easy and safe for riders of all levels.

Buck a Roo and the other horses were well cared for, calm, and friendly. The Preserve itself is expansive and scenic, with the views getting more beautiful the deeper you go. For the price, the experience was outstanding. They also provided fruit cups, snacks, and water before and after the ride, nice thoughtful details.

I’m even considering taking future lessons with them to learn more. If you’re looking for a safe, scenic trail ride run by true horse people, this is it.

Would definitely recommend A&A Adventure Horse Trail Rides at Robbins Preserve. Happy Trails!",2025-07-06 18:01:45,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQlH6nrbRWt8IPjfeutvgTG3u9xFT4tnm5EldV0iOxVpO8uJ3_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 17:57:53.582204,,

He could barely communicate and had a hard time saying two word phrases, and understand what he was saying. As time passed, Conner was progressing very well. He learned all of his letters and numbers by name a recognition. He was able to answer very simple questions.

In the handler sessions, we as the owner and understanding the kind of relationship/communication we have with our dog. The main goal was to help with her leash reactivity—she used to tug so hard I’d end up with rope burns, and she would often lunge at other dogs on walks.

Now, she walks by my side and no longer pulls like before. The transformation has been incredible. We noticed progress within the first week, and now nearing the end of the program, I feel more in control, which gives me peace of mind and allows her to safely enjoy the outdoors. Everyone at ACA is so knowledgeable—you can tell they truly understand the psychology of canine behavior.

The trainers are not only highly skilled, but they also kept me updated every single day with how she was doing, which made me feel really involved and supported. My dog absolutely adores them—she gets so excited to see them each morning, and it’s clear she built a strong, positive connection with the entire team.

My daughter has learned so much in such a short period of time thanks to Adalyns devine devotion to teach. This has become my daughter’s happy place and for that I’m forever grateful.

Another thing that makes this farm stand out from the rest is the enchanting selection of horses they share for all age groups. The horses are so social and soft and gentle.

ABA Autism Therapy of Florida,(954) 235-1530,ChIJbSaAq1UB2YgRgTI_2ZvlzCE,Corrine Jalecia,5,"Owner Mindy Lee & RBT Carolina is freaking amazing! I was referred by my child’s ESE Specialist at Wingate Oaks Center to this company when I was in need of getting my son ABA therapy. I had no idea what it consisted of and where to start. I researched and spoke to so many companies and I was not comfortable with any of them. Either they were too money (insurance) focused, unfriendly or poor customer service, terrible reviews, or not accommodating.

But not this company. From the beginning and still, Ms. Lee has helped me every step of the way! She throughly explained what ABA was, how her company operated, how to obtain the evaluations needed for my son to qualify, & more! We’ve been using her company for about 3 months from this date and I am overwhelmed with how much my son’s assigned RBT Ms. Carolina has helped him grow, achieve, & ATTAIN goals we’ve been working on and towards that was listed on his IEP for almost a year and a half at school. Another amazing thing that makes her company stand out from the rest, is the fact that their goal is help your child become independent so that they won’t need to be dependent upon having an RBT for the rest of their school years. Their mission is to help your child manage on their own with the tools they’ve learned, with hopes for them to be matriculated into classes with Gen Pop. Of course this doesn’t mean that each child will be the same, but what will be is having like minded and goal oriented people to help support you and your child become successful in their own way.

Unlike most ABA companies, who would rather hinder your child’s growth and development for their own gain such as money. THIS company is all about supporting, helping, and focusing on your child to help them become the best versions of themselves!!

I cannot thank Ms. Carolina, Ms. Lee, & Sabrina his analyst enough for all that they have and ARE doing to help me and my son. The relief of anxiety as been such a great feeling. Ms. Lee even volunteered to tour the new school my son will be attending for kindergarten next year. She and his RBT have been so supportive in so many ways.

I would like to say thank you to the staff at ABA centers of Florida. From the initial call, the staff was professional, warm, patient and accommodating. You could feel the compassion and genuineness through the phone. As a mother with a child on the spectrum, it was important to find an ABA company to accommodate his needs. ABA centers went above and beyond from day one ensuring that my child had no gap in services. The admissions process was smooth and efficient with great communication regarding progress and updates. The CEO Nicole is an angel from Heaven. It is such a great feeling to know that someone understands your struggle and will love and advocate for your child as much as you will. The staff we interact with wants the best for our child and it shows on all levels. If you are looking for a great company to provide services to your child ( THIS IS IT).

My brother just got a German Shepard and I told him to trust no one else except Applied Canine Concepts (due to all of the wasted time and money on other places locally). They were so accommodating in teaching my brother the skills as well as his new puppy.

Gina checked in quite often the first few weeks to make sure everything was going okay, and to offer training advice if I had any questions.

He has been a team mate, and someone who has involved himself with the community.  He is constantly asking how certain members are doing after he has treated them.  He is always communicating what to look out for for those members he has treated, and how to help them during class. As a business partner, he has been fantastic.  As a therapist, he rises above.  He isn’t a “treat you forever” therapist, but one who wants to get you fixed, healed, and on your way to continue accomplishing your goals.  He is very conscious of what his clients take best to as far as treatment plans and is very sensitive if there are certain treatments or rehabilitation exercises that a patient may not enjoy or doesn’t work for them.  He is constantly researching, teaching, and educating his clients.

The place looks old and outdated, but the real problem is with the staff, We took our child there for speech therapy and the girl (Jennifer) who was assigned to our case is really impatient and has a bad attitude. Not patient enough to deal with children and she has a bad temper, she was very agressive with my wife when she tried to assist her and help her how to deal with our son to get better results. Then she got upset and told my wife that ""WE ARE DONE HERE"" Then my wife took our son and left. Never going back there. What a shame that a place like that would hire agressive and impatient employees. She should never have a job dealing with kids with a temper like that.

She’s incredibly knowledgeable—especially with dry needling and strengthening exercises—and she made me feel confident that my knee pain would improve.

Anika took the time to explain everything, answered all my questions, and built a plan that was really personalized. The dry needling helped relieve a lot of the pain and tightness, and the exercises actually worked—I started noticing improvements pretty quickly.

The whole team at ASR is welcoming and professional, and the atmosphere is friendly and low-stress.

I met Andrew, one of the owners, at an event my gym was hosting and chatted with him about my upcoming left lateral meniscus repair surgery. As a full time trainer, I was worried about recovery time and regaining full functionality and mobility post-op. He listened intently and explained about all his clinic has to offer.

They work almost exclusively with not just athletes - but people - of all levels, their PTs and staff are fully certified and are always looking for opportunities to continue their education. AVION also has the latest in sports rehab and physical therapy tech, from dry needling, cupping, red light therapy, and blood flow restriction therapy. The center itself is also clean, spacious, well maintained and stocked with everything for rehab and prehab!

My PT, Nicole, is on a different level. She’s incredibly intelligent, has a lot of experience, meticulous in her attention to detail, is an athlete herself and is a joy to work with. I’ve worked out for years and have had to recover from my share of injuries and I can honestly say she’s the best PT I’ve had the pleasure of working with.

I cannot recommend the team at AVION enough. As a fitness professional, I feel at home here. “It’s not normal to exercise in pain.” This is the first sign you see when you walk into the clinic and it’s a statement the team here lives by with every second of every session.

I honestly do not have a bad thing to say about any of our experiences. We have been so fortunate to work with some of the BEST physical therapists in the state - Mandi, Heather & Tonya are beyond AMAZING!!! Mandi has been our primary therapist for most of the intensives and our daughter has come to love & adore her as if she was family. She actually gets so excited to start each intensive and is sad when they are over. I have never doubted any of their abilities - and I’m always in awe of how they adapt to any situation and problem solve on the spot. They make each exercise fun which is a huge bonus for our daughter in order to keep her engaged. And while we have not done any occupational therapy while there, we have come to know several of the therapists (Corrine & Tally) and they are equally as AMAZING!

I love that they have a large enough space to be able to do so many activities without ever feeling cramped for space like other facilities we have been to. Also to note, they do utilize the Therasuit with PT intensives and I highly recommend!

We’ve been lucky to do her last 2 intensives with another friend with similar attributes - which is highly motivating for the both of them!

Ability Plus Therapy,(321) 255-6627,ChIJKVGWdeAO3ogR0fq8MVjBu0Q,J Seifel,5,"Ability Plus was a complete answer to prayer. I had been struggling with finding a PT for my youngest son (who has a diagnosis of HIE and developmental delays) because I felt like none of them would listen to me. This is definitely not the case at Ability Plus! We were blessed to be partnered with Mandi Porter, who is one of the most patient people I have ever encountered. She has a wide variety of tools that she uses when treating my son and she really honors what he shows her. She is able to identify when to push him and when to back off. He loves her very much and smiles just when we mention her name.

We just completed our 3rd round of intensive therapy through Ability with Mandi and we are blown away by how God has used Mandi and Ability to help our son. He has far surpassed what the doctors originally said he would be able to do.

Ability utilizes the neurological and physical connection through the therasuit. My son loves putting the suit on and it blows my mind that work is being done by even just WEARING it. But they wear the suit while doing exercises to increase those connections in the brain.

I have to mention the familial atmosphere that happens at Ability. It is a warm, welcoming environment. Most the of the therapists know my son's name - and they don't even treat him! As you walk through the center, you hear lots of laughs and joy. Your child is really SEEN here. I also appreciate how the leadership makes rounds through the clinic and is aware of what is going on with each client. They will literally stop and talk to each child as they walk through the clinic. It really is mind blowing that they take time to do this.

Finally, I have to give a shout out to the front of house. Anyone knows that the front sets the tone and that is true here as well. The ladies in the front have a ready smile and welcome for each person and really treat you as a person, not a number. They too, genuinely care for each patient.

I highly recommend Ability Plus for treatment. Although we have only gone for intensive PT treatment, I have gotten to see the therapists in OT and ST and feel very comfortable recommending them as well.

If you are wondering if it is worth the drive or flight or whatever you have to take to get here - it is. :)",2024-07-22 08:25:18,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLgV2IZrjlSuxd2aNLAJnLDBTy_PEBwehVyzSLSgrg_hJtl4w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 17:58:18.512798,,

Her approach was thoughtful, compassionate, and highly skilled. It genuinely felt like her care was the missing piece I needed—like the cherry on top of my recovery process.

From the very first appointment, Tyler took the time to thoroughly evaluate my condition and develop a personalized treatment plan tailored specifically for my upper and lower back needs. His expertise and hands-on approach are truly outstanding.

What sets Tyler apart is his genuine care and commitment to his patients' well-being.

Tyler creates a comfortable and supportive environment, making it easy for me to discuss my progress and any challenges I might be facing.

During my previous round of therapy sessions with Tyler, I experienced significant relief from my back pain and improved mobility. I always request him because I know he can deliver exceptional results. This time around, I am already feeling the benefits of his care and expertise.

The entire staff is welcoming and friendly, scheduling is a breeze and you never have to worry about not receiving a call back if you leave a message. Kurt is absolutely amazing.

I know these things take time but I have literally tried every form of pain management and nothing has worked and/or taken the edge off until now. My coach suggested I try Dry Needling and I was so happy that Kurt offered that service (among other things to help with stretching/mobility).

Action Physical Therapy,(772) 212-1111,ChIJN4xvCofr3ogR4h1EtInf06E,L D,3,"The three stars are because of friendly office staff and the friendly PTA,Tyler, and the two techs, Diana and Brandy, plus the fact I learned some exercises from Tyler. My concerns are that I saw a PT once for a quick evaluation and was set up with a session with a Physical Therapy Assistant- who did a few EXCELLENT sessions and then I was passed off to techs/aides who are not licensed or certified as Physical Therapy Assistants. I saw no credentials or badges so this is left me to figure this out. The techs/aids tried to perform manual massage on me with what I believe to be very little training. It’s my understanding this is outside the scope of a tech/aid. On Fridays only the techs saw me without a Physical Therapist or Physical Therapy assistant on the premises. Diana and Brandy often tried to do the best they could and were exceptionally kind. A chiropractor was working in his office on Fridays. However it’s my understanding that legally, in Florida, a chiropractor cannot supervise aides or techs in the practice of physical therapy. When one tech told me she’d be working with me one Friday because she lost a game of rock, paper, scissors, I asked to only work with Tyler again, the certified Physical Therapy Assistant. I was told the PTA didn’t work on Fridays so I made appointments for the other days and was told in the afternoons there might be a lag while he worked with other patients. The staff kindly made the adjustment and were professional. More frequently Tyler asked if he could just finish up with me on another day because he was running out of time/seeing so many patients. The last assessment suggested I would benefit from continuing for a while longer. However the last time I was there Tyler said stiffness was normal at my age and shrugged and said he’d catch me next time.That was the second day in a row. I was just going and doing exercises I knew how to do. I could have voiced my frustrations earlier and I don’t know if it would have changed much or I would have been perceived as difficult; by now I already felt like a huge inconvenience. I’ve been in physical therapy two other times in my life. The last time it was about two or three years ago with South Florida Ortho in Tradition (SFO). At SFO, techs/aids assisted PTAs and PTs but did not take over patients. At SFO, although exercises and stretches were increasingly performed with more independence, there was always SOME one-on-one guidance and time with a PT or PTA at every session. This time SFO’s PT practice was so full they referred me here (to Action) up so I wouldn’t have to wait so long, which I respect. However, if there isn’t adequate time to see every patient in this practice (Action) at a particular time/day and with a PT or PTA present, some patients shouldn’t be scheduled. If I had been told there wasn’t adequate PT/PTA staff or supervision available I could have sought therapy elsewhere. Instead, it seems like the focus on profit and quantity is at the expense of consistent patient care and quality here.

Update- the licensed professional to which the response to this review refers is a licensed chiropractor who was in his office there on the Fridays  I was seen. There was no PT or PTA present with the techs/aides who were working with patients. It is my understanding that a chiropractor cannot provide supervision to PTs, PTAs, or their techs/aides.",2025-10-03 11:16:57,a week ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLsD5tPScNT-0DOcrU36c75o8NnPGS-9BiYHC5nSnRalpjX4A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 17:58:31.619429,,

Action Physical Therapy & Chiropractor,(954) 947-2167,ChIJk7W5U3sH2YgRt2vcreR1cpc,Robert Charming,1,"Incredibly disappointing experience with Action Physical Therapy—both overall and specifically with this location. Despite submitting appointment requests twice through their online portal, I was forced to repeatedly re-provide all my information because “no one could find me” in their central scheduling system.

When I attempted to call this location directly, several times over several hours, no one ever answered. Each time I was routed to the central line where, yet again, no one could locate my information.

Thinking it would be easier to handle in person, I stopped by. That was a mistake. The man at the desk looked bewildered that someone had dared to walk in. When I explained I was there to schedule an appointment, an older woman eventually came over and asked for my name. When I said Robert, she scoffed, “Full name,” in a condescending tone—as if I were somehow at fault. It was insulting.

I explained that I had submitted two online requests with all my information already—one for today and one for two days out. She insisted there was “nothing in the system” and even claimed it was impossible to request a slot for today, even though I'd done it on Saturday. Only when I pulled up my email confirmations did she begrudgingly acknowledge it, still with an incredulous attitude.

Even then, she demanded my information yet again and said she “might” have availability on Wednesday—contradicting the online system that clearly showed openings. At that point, I walked out.

Frankly, I’m glad I did. The space itself was harshly lit with fluorescent bulbs, dated, and unwelcoming. In hindsight, the complete lack of professionalism and customer service was a blessing—it spared me from wasting any more time with this place.",2025-08-18 14:10:48,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVdbv9YrJsxSqAYBe9APWNOA2Ugo9MaC4GCyNCRroVyrLyID-UA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 17:58:32.217602,,

Their senior therapist is the most disrespectful man I’ve ever met. Count your days if you think I’m letting it go!

My son has been coming in for the same treatment for the past few months. We just needed a new referral to start a new session and continue with the same care. This man decided to tell me I was wrong and claimed my son was never treated for these injuries. Mind you, he never treated my son, nor has he ever evaluated him. He doesn’t know my son’s health history or why he was coming there in the first place —

He only ever saw my son just to put Kinesio tape around his Achilles — twice — because I specifically asked him to, because his original therapist didn’t know how. Instead of admitting that, he just didn’t remember or recall . he claimed he never helped my son and that I don’t know anything about his chart. He said my son has never been seen for his injuries and that his chart has changed — but may I mind you  his chart has not changed. It became more detailed.

My son has been dealing with the same injury since August. From being hospitalized a month from being seen from surgeon to surgeon for  past few months for this man to tell as a mother. I don’t know what I’m talking about I’m incorrect is crazy to me — sir, you are out of line.

You sat in that room spoke to me like I was crazy just to come out and stand in everyone face to act like what happened didn’t happened I should have recorded you !!!

"Active Med Pros - Dr Justin Dempsey, DC",(239) 458-5747,ChIJnWOHz9U524gRDUl2GW5M6mg,Samuel Robles,5,"When I originally came in, I was in a lot of pain. My back and my neck were so bad I could barely perform any activities without excruciating pain, including sitting and walking. Dr. Dempsey and his team, Matt, Jess, and Shayna, informed me of some of the treatment options they have available and I went with the 9 week program (18 sessions for neck and back) and I couldn’t believe it at first. But the results are VERY REAL and VERY WORTH EVERY PENNY. Not only is my back and neck pain gone, but I’m sleeping better, I have more energy, and I’m able to do more than I was able to do before the back pains even started. People may not realize this, but your back and neck problems lead to other symptoms and disorders in your body that could easily be taken care of if you attack the source of the problem. I didn’t realize how much of a difference this treatment program would make in my life until I actually saw the results and went through it all. At 41 years old, I have more energy than ever before, my back and neck issues are rectified and gone, and I’m able to perform at 100% in my trade because of the amazing work that Active Med Pros did on me. My family is reaping the benefits of it to as I am able to be more active with them and be more involved in extracurricular activities. Trust me when I say, it is WORTH IT and very reasonable when it comes to the longevity of the repairs that you will receive when going with Active Med Pros. You can’t put a price on your health and well-being, and even so, compared to other treatments from “medical professionals,” their holistic and innovative approach to providing treatment is not only effective, but it also benefits others areas of the body, for example, my blood pressure has stabilized and has gone down, my libido is more active, and it’s even contributed to weight loss!

Dr. Ratree also took pictures and videos while I was doing various exercises which made me uncomfortable and felt weird. Worst of all, Dr. Ratree asked what medications I was taking and when I told her I was on an anti-anxiety medication she told me that I would not recover as quickly and suggested I take magnesium instead.

We did have a bad experience with one therapist, and had another therapist say something negative to me about another child which made it clear she did not “see” this child(or mine) for who they are. My daughter had a favorite ST, but she couldn’t get a regular schedule with her so was cycled through other therapists instead. Getting an awesome therapist is definitely hit or miss here. My daughter was with ATP for about 2 years, yet when it was time to move away from the area, we received no response to emails including additional questions I had for her development during the transition period, so that was frustrating and made it feel like her presence there was not valued. The first year was better than the second and it started to be less consistent at some point. There were a couple instances of the schedule being changed without any notice so I started having to call to clarify. Some of my questions about my daughter’s specific learning style and speech disorder were dismissed with no further evaluations or questions.

When I began physical therapy, I was in a great deal of pain and extremely frightened about the future use of my hand. Even though it was, thankfully, my non dominant arm I was quite limited in what I could do. I was blessed indeed to have Sly Edwards as my therapist. It was clear to me that he is extremely knowledgeable and competent. Equally important was the fact that he is kind, encouraging, and supportive.  He realized that I was traumatized by the entire incident, and he therefore needed to address psychological issues as well. He was a taskmaster, clearly believing that I could have a successful outcome. I am so very grateful that I ended up at this facility and in his care. I would recommend him without reservation.

Ira is an excellent Physical Therapist.  He is very knowledgeable, caring and extremely supportive of his patient's needs. My surgery was a reverse shoulder replacement.  Ira knew exactly how to manage the pain and swelling in my arm. He knew the exact stretching exercises for me to perform in order to stretch my arm muscles. Ira is very gentle as he maneuvers my arm so I can retain the flexibility I need for daily use without pain and discomfort. He also knew the weight training exercises to build my deltoid, tricep, and bicep muscles which were terribly weak.

I went to see Dr. Kranz to find answers, after a comprehensive examination she determined that I actually do have an injury, potentially a collapsing arch plus my running form is not the best which could be the reason of my injury or a consequence of this, in this treatment we are address both. She designed a 10 week rehabilitation program that includes exercises to make my ankle, arch, glutes and legs stronger to help heal my injury and improve my running form. I’ve been following her work out routine for the past two weeks, doing the exercises 4 times a week and I already feel a stronger and able to control my stride a little better again (everything started with what I call a “wobbly” ankle). It is a work in progress and running is not 100% enjoyable yet, but in only two weeks I can feel a difference and have noticed that I no longer have pain after I run, my arch and top of the foot don’t hurt anymore during the run and I can control those “wobbly movements” a little better. During her initial examination she was even able to notice that my right leg seems shorter then the left  and this is an issue that an orthopedist treated when I was a child, my right hip is a couple of inches higher than the left so the fact that she was able to see that impressed me.

As a kid I always wanted a Saint Bernard but my Pop didn't think I was ready for such a big dog with a huge responsibility. Later my wife and I while living in Las Vegas NV after we lost a pet we came across a Saint and rescued him, from that day we fell in love with the breed. When our beloved Bear died we wanted a Saint. We found Sandy Beach Saints and Jackie, not only did she have all the requirements as a breeder but when we reached out to her unlike other breeders she talked to us about our history with dogs and told us insights on the breed we didn't know she also answered many questions that other breeders don't, she seemed very caring about who she let adopt one of her babies. That has led us to our 1st Saint from Sandy Beach Saints and Jackie. We got Norbert 2 years 4months ago. And when Norbert needed and wanted a friend we went right back to Jackie. Her dogs are extremely smart and well breed. The care and love Jackie has for the breed is apparent. So getting a 2nd it was a no Brainer. In walked Thundarian, he has the same Dad as Norbert just a different Mommy. We are very happy with Sandy Beach Saints and Jackie. I highly recommend her and her excellent Puppies!

In the end, my knees are pain-free and stronger  than they have been for ten years.
In my time there I observed that all of the therapists and the other patients in the room always appeared to be jovial, which is pretty good considering that some of the exercises might be grueling.  It was an atmosphere that made us want to do our best while working hard to improve our mobility.

Upon completing my evaluation, I was scheduled for 3 days a week for PT and Tylor was attentive, considerate, and helpful in communicating my steps in each session.

"Align Physical Therapy, Inc.",(321) 804-8132,ChIJw19CYrER3ogReLPvpKejzaU,Cynthia NeJame,5,"When I had a nasty break in my arm after a bicycle accident, Tyler at Align Physical Therapy in Melbourne Beach was recommended, and I couldn't be happier with both my treatment or the office itself which is a little jewel! Upon entering my very first time, I was greeted by Katie who is a ray of sunshine no matter what time my appointment. She is friendly, overly accommodating, and makes you so happy that you walked in the door at this bright and sparkly clean Melbourne Beach treatment center.
Tyler's focus is to get me to ""100%"". His credo is ""the goal is the goal"", and my progress is a testimony to that.
Amidst the strides I was making in the range of motion in my arm, out of left field (and over four days after my pt session), I woke up one morning with an excruciating pulled muscle or pinched nerve in my back accompanied by a vertigo like dizziness that severely impacted my ability to move, let alone work on arm strengthening. It was greatly debilitating at best. Rather than dismiss me until I could work on my arm again, Tyler totally took command, helping me exponentially with both my dizziness and my back muscle until I could get back to my original objective of getting my range of arm motion to 100%.
Tyler's knowledge is impressive, but his application of it speaks volumes to his skill, particularly as he magically kneads ""angry muscles"" back into place. Tyler is selfless, and is willing to work as hard as he needs to achieve goals. I left a session today where he literally massaged and manipulated my arm for over 35 minutes until he was convinced that my muscles loosened up considerably. He is RELENTLESS in the most positive way. Tyler is not happy with good enough, and takes his clients'  successes personally until he absolutely maximizes their potential to not only totally heal, but to soar.   ""Soaring"" can sometimes feel ""sore"", but I leave every session feeling motivated, grateful and empowered to be my best. I could not recommend Tyler and this particular office more highly. THANK YOU, Tyler and Katie
I am updating my review as I move forward with a significant increase in my range of motion. Unfortunately, Katie has left, but in my three months at at Align, I also had the chance to meet an additional staff member over the phone whose patience was absolutely over the top. Madeline endured countless telephone calls with my insurance company to help me to get continued coverage. She not only was able to conference me in to phone calls with my insurance company and the appeals department when necessary, but she followed up on a daily basis to advocate for me. Madeline could not have done any more on my behalf, and I am so deeply grateful for her patience, professionalism, and kindness.
I'm hoping that if I ever need to come back here for any reason that I get to meet Madeline in person, there will be flatscreen TVs set up, and we will be listening to Chase Ryland (Katie's replacement) during my therapy sessions because he will have made it to the top of Nashville's finest!",2025-03-25 11:11:27,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLkh35sISH4ZDJuPYkjbw_bPpNpN03CJDN62iGNRena_3YkJQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 17:59:09.861727,,

Besides waking better and without nagging knee pain , we now sleep well at night too without getting up from the knee pain in the middle of the night .

Alkeme Sports Rx,(954) 800-5826,ChIJszDUJ2Go2YgRfrB1Px4-JZM,Carbsie,5,"After surgical repair of a femur fracture and lateral meniscus tear from a car accident, I spent a year recovering on my own with some basic physical therapy. It helped me regain my ability to walk and return to daily life, but I was still far from where I needed to be in the gym as a body builder — squats and lunges were nearly impossible, and I wasn’t making meaningful strength or hypertrophy gains.

ALKEMĒ SPORTS RX changed that for me. From my first visit, everyone made me feel welcome and supported. The facility is modern, clean, fully equipped. Even with multiple patients in the space, the level of focus and personalization I receive never wavers. Every session is thoughtfully designed around my specific injury, body mechanics, and goals.

The therapists took the time to quantify my deficits objectively, and use that data to design custom programming that truly challenges me. We work with a range of modalities—neuromuscular electrical stimulation, blood flow restriction, and targeted exercises—to rebuild the mind-muscle connection in areas that had stopped firing properly. After just five sessions, I’ve already seen a 20% increase in strength and am finally feeling my muscles engage again during training.

Thank you Jamie for keeping everything organized and running smoothly, and to Dr. Omari, Dr. Bryan, and Dr. Chris for collaborating so effectively to help me make such quick, meaningful progress.

Angelina's a Speech Pathologist with years of experience with all sorts of children in need.  If you have a child that suffers with shuddering to even not being able to communicate from a Traumatic Brain Injury, Angelina is your therapist. My daughter Bella had a problem communicating and the way she spoke at times kids would make fun of her. She had low self esteem and lacked the confidence to show others how awesome she really is. I reached out to Angelina and within a few days she was able to come to my home and start helping Bella. After working with Bella for a few weeks Angelina was able to boost her confidence and show her the way to communicate which allowed her to open up to others.
So again, please follow All About Kids Therapy. The great thing that separates Angelina from the rest is that she comes to you, where your child feels the most  comfortable and safe.

My son didn’t show any improvement in his speech, and he still isn’t talking. I stayed with them for almost two years, and throughout that time, I saw no real progress.

Every month or two, they would switch his speech therapist — one leaves, another comes in — and it kept going like that. They all say the same things over and over, and every session felt like a repeat of the last. “We’re doing this, we’re doing that,” but nothing ever changed.

At some point, it just felt like empty talk and false promises. I started feeling like they were just going through the motions, not truly working on my child’s development.

We recently completed the 2-week board-and-train program with All Dogs Unleashed for our dog, Roux, and we could not be happier with the results! From the very beginning, the team was professional, friendly, and clearly passionate about what they do.

Before training, Roux was a sweet dog but had a hard time focusing and following through with commands—especially with distractions. After just 2 weeks, we brought home a dog who listens, responds, and is so much more confident. It’s like we unlocked his full potential!

The trainers, especially Joe, didn’t just work with Roux—they worked with us too, making sure we understood each command, how to reinforce them at home, and how to keep his progress going. They were patient, knowledgeable, and genuinely cared about Roux’s success.

We’re so thankful for the love, effort, and skill they poured into our pup.

My dog is generally a well-tempered and affectionate little guy. That all changed when he sees another dog. He starts barking and growling and pulling on the leash.
Within one training session, Chrissy had him following commands, walking comfortably and by the end of the hour, we were even able to get him to be in THE SAME ROOM with another dog like it was no big deal.

Ellie went to school today (her first class was 2 weeks ago) and holy moly she has done so well. I have poured massive amounts of time and energy into her, ensuring she gets a good foundation and I am not looking for an ""obedient"" dog, just a well grounded polite pup. The first week of class she practically ignored me and was more interested in Chrissy Dullano with All Fur Pets than me. But this week she was all about paying attention to me and wanting to see what I had planned next - it was like night and day difference from week one to today. Sometimes when were doing ""the homework"" from our training classes we dont really see the results and then you put it to the test in class and I was just blown away by how much Ellie has matured, learned, and retained.

🫶🐕🫶And Chrissy is amazing. She has helped me to lower my expectations since Ellie is still a puppy and she is helping to guide me as I navigate different and new things with Ellie.

Moreover, she was so enthusiastic and high energy that it was hard not to get totally engrossed in each session. While the tactics we worked on certainly helped our son, I think they had even a bigger impact on us as parents - we learned tons of new ways to communicate and manage issues, and we felt like we had the power to make things better.

"All-Star Speech, LLC",(352) 616-0649,ChIJq6oOBsegwogR4MjnCp75iE8,J. S.,5,"All star speech is a God send. As a teacher of 16 years who worked with children with special needs, and a parent of children with speech delays, apraxia of speech and auditory processing disorder, I can tell you that All Star Speech is by far the most child centered, effective and nurturing environment I could have ever asked for. They understand the behavioral challenges of children who have struggled with speech and other delays and they are well prepared to handle whatever comes their way. They treat my children with kindness and understanding all while challenging them, facilitating growth and pushing them towards progress. Vicky has the patience and calmness of a saint, Melissa does a great job helping parents understand what they can do to help their children and Liz has a way of helping kids without them even realizing that that’s what she is doing.
The growth I have seen in my two children is nothing short of astonishing. My previously non-verbal child LOVES going to speech and practicing new sounds and “playing” games, all the while he is making progress towards being verbal. He had some serious behavioral challenges when we first came a year and a half ago, and his speech therapist never gave up on him. She worked through the problems with him and consulted with his occupational therapist who also works onsite, and now my son happily goes to speech every week.
As a parent, I can tell you that I know my children are safe and actively learning while they are at All Star Speech. I am so thankful to have found them because without them I highly doubt my children would have made such progress.
If you are looking for a place that will truly help your child, I highly suggest looking into All Star Speech.

If you are looking for an occupational therapist Desire who runs Wonder Kids at the same location, is one of a kind. She took my son on and has worked to help him start writing and so much more. He went from nothing but scribbles to being able to write most of his alphabet, sorting like a pro and most importantly she works with him on his sensory regulation. He went from not being able to sit and focus for more than 2 minutes to being able to sit and focus for periods of time up to 30 minutes! She has even helped me learn ways to help him, help himself and I’m an ESE teacher! She is simply the most amazing occupational therapist I have ever seen.
She does not shy away from a challenge and I can tell you that when I first brought my son to her, it was truly a challenge. She has done an amazing job. My only regret is that I didn’t take him to her sooner.
I even recommended her to my neighbors who have since started bringing their daughter to her and the growth is amazing!
Long story short, if you have child who needs speech and/or OT, this is the place you want to take them. The collaborative efforts of both speech and OT have been a game changer for my son and the changes I see in him are nothing short of a miracle.",2023-05-11 14:19:25,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIGNeI73ptiV-vCdP5xA5BAUI74gEjP3S_2QnA44sRERYmQNw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 17:59:20.766259,,

Being in a business where you see so many dogs, it said a lot for the amount of time he spent with Rollo and the feelings he formed for him  I have a feeling that he is that way with all of his dogs.

Unfortunately I’ve been to a lot of treatment facilities but Ambrosia was by far the best - like 100x better. I actually loved it there a little too much as I went through their inpatient program 8 times. That wasn’t because it wasn’t an amazing program it was me that was the problem. I constantly self sabotaged and didn’t know how to function in the world sober and essentially became institutionalized. (The last time I went they told me it was the last time and I was black listed and wouldn’t be allowed to come back because they realized I had an unhealthy comfortability with the facility. I truly did consider it my home. Every time I went I really did try my hardest and the staff did everything in their power to help and support me including sending me to an outside trauma therapist who I worked with for 4 years and she helped me immensely. I wish I could say ambrosia was the last place I went to but it took a lot more rehabs for me to finally get out of my own way. It doesn’t seem like any of the staff is still there (I went the first time in 2011) but they truly cared and helped keep me safe from my own self and I’ll forever be grateful. I don’t think I would be alive today if I never went to ambrosia or if I didn’t go as many times as I did.  Actually I know I wouldn’t. So this review goes out to everyone that worked there a long time ago.

It sounded good when I got transfered there. It was nice I suppose. I ended up AMAing one day and they wouldn't charge my phone because ""that's enabling "" (mind you,  this was my first time in Florida at all. I literally had been in a different unit for 28 days before being transferred there). So I was walking with no phone and my bags. A car with 2 women and a baby offered to let me charge my phone in their car. They drove me to their house and it was a pimps house. I declined the free heroin many times and eventually gave in. I was raped , overdosed, and then I was left half naked in a ditch.  Thr police/ems found me not breathing or responding.

Now, none of that was ambrosias fault. (Except maybe help establish a safety plan? Or charge the phone? )

I heard from residents this is one of the nicest recovery centers in the state, if not whole East Coast. The Staff are friendly and helpful, Doctors are knowledgeable, Nurses are considerate. You will receive round the clock care every day of the week. The food is Chef cooked and different every day, residents are a huge fan of the meals and snacks! We have recreation outside to play basketball or get some sun. We have at least 4 classes a day, sometimes 6. Teachers are compassionate and knowledgeable. I had a great experience here and have no complaints about the facility after 23 days in treatment.

One of my concerns (which ended my treatment early on my part) is the lack of transparency on when you will be released. Some people are admitted 13 days and some 35 without any knowledge of which group one will fall into. Kylie is cold and unapproachable and provides zero communication on discharge timeframe which makes residents feel like hostages.

Our 2 frenchies Blue and Charlie had some behavioral issues—pulling on the leash, not following commands, and being anxious around strangers. After just a few sessions, we saw a huge improvement.

Pilar  doesn’t just train your dog—she teach you how to communicate better and build a stronger bond. She was always responsive, supportive, and tailored the sessions to fit our needs.

Thanks to Pilar’s guidance, our babies are now much more obedient, calm, and confident. I highly recommend Angel Paws to anyone looking for a kind, effective, and knowledgeable dog trainer.

Animal Cancer Care Clinic,(407) 930-6679,ChIJ612Iqptn54gR3HdgsIlUd_4,Kyle St Peter,1,"I have waited several months to leave a review. My Golden Retriever Grace was diagnosed with Leukemia in early January 2025. We started treatment at the University of Missouri Animal Hospital. I had sold my condominium and needed to relocate to Florida. I chose Animal Cancer Care Clinic for continued treatment. I also took her to two local animal hospitals. She was a difficult case with alternate diagnosis between acute and chronic leukemia. Her blood work was highly elevated. However, our experience between the University of Missouri and Animal Cancer Care Clinic was night and day. The University setting is a hospital with many doctors, students and all kinds of cancer treatments with numerous facility types and options. ACCC is a retail, storefront operation with traveling doctors who are trying to see as many patients in a day as possible. Many of the Doctors attended the same University and have found their way to Florida. We went to the Melbourne Clinic, I think they have an HQ in Orlando. I experienced long wait times before you see your Oncologist, you only get 10 minutes with your Oncologist and then it is support staff during appointments, and you never hear back from your Oncologist if you have questions between treatments. You call the main number and a support person is the go-between.  The human correlation to a “patient first” or “patient care” orientation is not their primary objective. I heard from both organizations there are too many pets and too few Oncologists after the pandemic. They are overworked and under staffed. If you love your pet as we all do and have a somewhat complicated case or want to spend more time with your Oncologist I strongly recommend the University setting. If I had it to do over I would have gone to the University of Florida. If you have a simple case and need basic blood work and treatment ACCC is a solid option as there are not many choices. The first photo is Grace after her last swim, the other two when she was healthy.

When I got in I noticed right away the bedside manner of the vet tech wasn’t that good at all so I thought well maybe the doctor will be better. The doctor came in and shook my hand did not really do anything to my dog other than say he was gonna give him a chest x-ray because he had been doing some coughing he gave him a chest x-ray came back and told methat there was opaque Looking in my Dogs chest x-ray. I asked him what that meant he said he didn’t really know. He acted very strange like he was almost afraid of my dog . My dog loves people and there’s no reason to be afraid of him at all he’s sweet . He was frightenedwhen they cut his nails And they took him away from me which I could’ve told him was just gonna make it worse,  whatever  they did To him,he was screaming in the back. It was so bad my son and I tried to get up and go find the room that they had him in we didn’t know what they were doing to him. So the vet tech  brought him back and his nails were still as long as when he went back there. I get it if it hurt him then just stop and tell me but instead they charged me for it and his nails are still long. The vet still has no answer answers as to what’s wrong with him he put him on the medication he was already taking From when he saw his old vet  he had been going to before but I thought maybe he needed a second opinion. WELL don’t believe the Affordable part they did nothing to him but a chest x-ray and didn’t even give me the medicine I had to order it off for chewy for an additional $38 and that’s only cause I was the first time Customer would’ve been more. The vet bill itself,. $480 later I still don’t know what’s wrong with my dog he’s being given steroids which is making him pee everywhere and I don’t feel like it’s helping anything. If anything I feel like it’s worse. Long story short this place I feel is a bait and switch and I’m not even so sure they barely have any experience and if they do I don’t know where their experience is from because I certainly didn’t think the doctor knew anything of what was going on and he didn’t even address the smell that I went there for in my dog’s mouth when I had spoken to the Female on the phone two times about looking for a bad tooth or a tooth infection. This doctor the male doctor, mentioned something about bronchitis but did not given antibiotic just a cough tablet with a steroid and when I called to tell him my dog was acting very strange on this medication he just told me that’s normal and I need to come back for a check up I’m not going back there no way!

She probably went years without adequate treatment of her allergies and infections, which lead to a misshapen flap, drug-resistant organisms, and limited quality of life.
We tried every ear drop, in every dose, for what seemed like forever, but her ears were still painful and her personality reflected that.
With Dr. Canfields guidance we moved forward with the LATERAL WALL RESECTION surgery and we couldn't have made a better choice for our girl, Paisley. Now 4 months post-op and this is a completely different dog. She is happy, she runs, she plays, she's no longer painful in that ear, and the surgery didn't leave her completely deaf.
A million thanks go out to Dr. Canfield and his incredible team. This isn't our first medically needy rescue dog and certainly won't be our last.

Animal Healing Solutions,(407) 308-7878,ChIJOYobyO9x54gRsKCw98UBoZw,Mary L,5,"INCREDIBLE VET FOR DOGS WITH BAD HIPS. Dr Fasano and Courtney at Animal Healing Solutions are absolutely incredible! I brought my elderly golden doodle to Dr Fasano who was recommended by a friend of mine.  Our golden doodle started limping as a puppy when she was only eleven months old. At that time, we took her to our vet and a specialist. The specialist diagnosed her with severe dysplasia, but because she was so young they didn’t recommend hip surgery. They also let us know that both hips were so severe that hip surgery may not be an option in the future.  Heartbroken we starting researching everything, and we were very fortunate to keep her pretty much limp free with special food, supplements, water therapy, specific exercises, red light therapy, massages and limited pain meds. However, at a little over 11 years old, she started having a lot of issues walking, and began limping again.  She was also showing pain by her personality changing.  Our regular vet put her on additional pain medicines to help.  We also consulted regarding hip surgery but were told she was not a candidate due to the severity of both hips. So we asked our vet about alternative therapy and he said we could try it.  That’s when we started with Dr. Fasano who started acupuncture and added additional supplements to the regime we already had in place. Right away after starting the acupuncture and new supplements, we noticed marked improvement in our dog.  She was limping less and could walk up stairs. After her third treatment the improvement was incredibly noticeable not only in her movement, but in her personality too! She went back to her happy, sweet and playful self. We are so excited that we are going to continue this treatment for her with Dr. Fasano! We also learned that acupuncture can help with a host of additional animal illnesses and issues, so we will be bringing our two senior cats who both have issues related to kidney and thyroid. My friend who recommended Dr Fasano said when her regular vet only gave her cat 6 months to live, her kitty lived another 2 years coming to Dr Fasano! We still love our regular vet, but coming to Dr Fasano for the additional treatment and supplements has made a world of difference and we are so grateful. Also, Courtney who runs Dr Fasano’s office is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this practice!",2025-08-18 12:43:53,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK82KRJ-6GD0cTFG-dXGc_dvACqj_D4ctiJ6kxYu63mJuOWFw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 17:59:40.741279,,

Over the years, some changes have come with the shift to corporate ownership; some good, some less so. The biggest drawback has been the noticeable increase in pricing and the tendency to charge for things that were once complimentary or very low cost.
That said, what keeps us here is Dr. Saladino and the incredible team. Dr. Saladino truly embodies everything a great doctor should be. She always puts her patient’s best interests first, takes the time to explain options, and never pressures us into treatments we don’t feel comfortable with or can’t afford. She has earned our complete trust.
The support staff, from the front desk to the vet techs, are equally outstanding. We have always felt listened to, never rushed, and treated with genuine care. Their dedication shines through in everything they do.
While we do wish the corporate side of things didn’t feel so focused on higher profits, we can’t say enough about the people who make this place special. Because of Dr. Saladino and the amazing staff, we wholeheartedly recommend this practice.

The prices were better than most vets in my opinion. The first exam was free and I forgot to ask at the desk as I was wrapped up in the good news of our dog. I called and they had already credited it back to my account for later use or I can get it refunded. The doctor was very thorough and asked questions I would not even think of. They started with xrays and bloodwork and even took us back to look at all the xrays. They did not push for unnecessary treatment or tests. The entire staff took good care of our boy and were caring. The doctor even called the next day herself to check on Bubba and wants a follow up the next week to see if he's feeling any better.

There were times I didn’t understand things, and they were very patient in re-explaining and hearing me out. Chelsea has an outstanding amount of empathy, wonderful energy, and calmness.

Chelsea even spotted a very minor detail/mistake on a health report from another place for my dog. She is very attentive to small details which I so appreciate because I feel that many vets just skim through reports.

Animal Hospital of Ft Lauderdale,(954) 561-8777,ChIJPVukF4wB2YgRrPQtTWZgXL0,Kayane Smith,1,"I waited several months before posting this review, not out of emotion, but to share a precautionary statement for anyone considering the Animal Hospital of Fort Lauderdale.

I previously worked in the veterinary services industry and have seen bad care before, but nothing compares to the negligence of this practice.

The front desk is inconsistent and often misleading. The vet techs were fine, and did their jobs. But Dr. Jones misdiagnosed my puppy, never weighed her, and prescribed antibiotics at less than half the correct dosage. When I raised concerns, she denied her own statements and spoke down to me instead of taking accountability.

I was also charged for a “wellness visit” that was NOT performed. When I complained, the owner dismissed my concerns, reducing them in a condescending way to a coworker, which was both insulting and unprofessional.

Additionally, do not purchase their “packages.” They are not true packages, but essentially payment plans—you are charged at every visit rather than paying upfront for bundled services. The front desk staff is inconsistent, and in my experience, some were not fully honest until I was already in the office.

While the owner was nice at first—even offering to drop off medication to me free of charge and in a random parking lot on his way home —he rescinded the offer immediately after meeting my handsome significant other, which was inappropriate and unprofessional.

Overall, I cannot recommend this clinic. I would not bring my pets here under any circumstances. Even in emergencies, I fear they would prioritize speeding through the process over providing proper, ethical care. I would never bring my pets here again. If you value honesty, proper care, and transparency, look elsewhere.",2025-08-25 21:33:08,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL0DQ4kgj8kWbWrhNojozXmile395UYecKcZSIjSBPDWnKDJQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 17:59:44.257693,,

My Corgi, Olive, ruptured her left hind CCL back in 2024. Dr. Clark was quick to diagnose the injury and confirmed it with testing and Xrays. Dr Clark and his team were the best. He didn't do the hard sell on surgery; However recommended it. He educated me on the benefits of repairing CCL injuries via surgery but there were alternatives. For us because Olive was just 3 years old at the time, surgery was the best option. Olive had an excellent surgery and was walking a day later and her full return to activates was about 6 weeks after surgery.

On Feb 13th, 2025, Olive ruptured her right hind CCL while playing at the dog park. Was this a surprise? No. Why? Because Dr Clark had advised me back in 2024, it was very likely that the opposite knee would rupture in the next year or so. I was prepared and educated. Once again, Dr Clark and his team were amazing. Olive is well on her way to making another fine recovery thanks to Animal Medical Hospital, Dr Clark, and his Team.

Apex Physical Therapy,(239) 573-8658,ChIJgfzVIF5G24gRCF5n8_-iOGc,Chris Romeo,5,"Been working Professional and Personally with APEX for years now.

Professionally - Incredible. As a Gym Owner, not only do they take care of many of our members, they also provide their services at our gym once a month. Additionally, every year we Host a Fitness Competition in which all proceeds go to the Salvation Army by way of asking participants and spectators to donate a toy for a child 3-12 years of age. This even draws hundreds of competitors and spectators. APEX provides services at this competition AND encourages their own people to donate towards this great cause.

Personally - As a ""weekend warrior"" I've used APEX's services to keep my body together. Last year I injured my shoulder at a local competition. I personally take very good care of myself through water, diet, sleep, mobility, etc. I tried everything to heal the injury including taking time off from using my shoulder, but the pain did not go away. In fact, it worsened as time went on. APEX was able to show me that I had a 50% tear on my bicep and pec. While I was doing all the right things, I needed Physical Therapy to restart the healing process. Additionally, because I had stopped using the shoulder, I created some pretty poor movement patterns as well as some compensating to the other side of my body. Within 1 session the pain went away. Within 2 sessions I had regained almost 90% of my mobility back.

I was also regularly seen by Mr Steve and Miss Andrea and they were always polite but pushed me to do better. Over 2 1/2 months I would say I have improved almost 100% in terms of pain and frequency of episodes. It has greatly improved my quality of life and mental health. I really wish I would have come sooner if I would have known it would be so easy.

Andrea is professional, approachable and personable in ways that enabled me to enjoy and look forward to our sessions. She is highly recommended!

Additionally, I wish to shout out to Leesa at the Hollywood location. While we did not work directly together, I was witness to her professional and infectious manner with her patients.

Debbie Butler is highly experienced. She gets right to the problem then offers the solution at a reasonable price,  We have been bringing our furry friends there for many yrs. Our latest adopted feline Ashford needed full mouth extractions. Debbie took care of it in a few hours and now a few days later he 's already perking up and eating soft food from A&B and on the mend. F-M-E is a very hard procedure to see your pet go through, but the only way to fix the infection, more so being FIV positive. If this is not done properly, the condition will get much worse requiring more radical surgery, not something to trust just any vet to do.

I’m really glad I met with Dr. Alex. I can honestly say I have never been to a PT doctor. I’ve been working out since I was an adolescent. I usually know how to implement self care & recovery.

At discharge my mother could sit up on her own with little assist, speaking better, less confusion with better word recognition, brushing her teeth, eating on her own!!  We still have a long way to go, but I am so thankful to God for guiding us to Ascension inpatient rehab. They literally became our second family. It was almost hard to say goodbye to them, but we understand they got mama to her first destination in this long journey ahead. Plus they have other peoples lives to positively make a difference in.

We rescued a Bully, and while I instantly bonded with her, she did not get along with my wife and stepson. It was a stressful situation, and I knew we needed help. After searching on Yelp, I found this trainer and scheduled an in-home evaluation.

From the start, Juan impressed me with his knowledge and professionalism. He even offered a 3-day boot camp at no cost, and when our dog came back, she was like a completely different dog. That alone showed me how skilled he was. We immediately enrolled her in the full board-and-train program, and the results were nothing short of life-changing.

When our dog returned, she and my wife bonded right away—something I wasn’t sure would ever happen. The trainer (shout out to Ronald) not only worked wonders with her but also gave us detailed explanations of her behavior, why she was reacting the way she did, and how to correct unwanted behavior going forward.
I get compliments all the time on how well trained my dog is.

Thanks to Asger K9’s expertise and dedication, our family now has the harmony we hoped for.

Asger K9,(786) 439-6665,ChIJvbWYcIal2YgRsg8DnaBIcG0,Alina Zea,5,"Outstanding Training Experience with Asgerk9

I am not an easy client and I’m very picky about everything and anything. With that being said,  I will always use Asgerk9 for training my pocket bully, Bruce. He started the program at 4 months old. I am thrilled with the outcome from their board and train program. From our first meeting with Juan, it was clear that he has a profound understanding of dog behaviors and effective training especially with my silly lil pup. The best part about that meeting is that he respected my particular ways with the dog. I wanted him to be trained with the least amount of treats possible and he eats a raw food diet. Juan was respectful towards my requests and they did exactly that.

Juan, Rey, and Pablo are always professional and communicated effectively whenever I reached out to them for updates on Bruce. They took the time to explain each training technique in a way that was easy for both Bruce and myself to grasp.

The training methods used by Asgerk9 were not only humane but highly effective. Bruce showed significant improvements in his behavior, particularly with focus, attention and on leash training, within just a few weeks. One thing i absolutely loved was that you can visit your pup wherever they’re training that day and see how the trainer works in action so it’s easier to understand when you pick him up. Asgerk9 also provided us with not only the tools but effective strategies to continue Bruce's personalized training at home, which has been incredibly helpful.

I want to emphasize the personalized training because there are certain things that I needed him to do as far as tasks and they made it very simple for me to go ahead and teach him these things.

Asgerk9's patience was and continues to be remarkable (both with Bruce and myself). Training can be challenging, Bruce is a pit mixed w staffy so even as a puppy they are strong and silly but AsgerK9’s calm and positive approach made the process enjoyable for Bruce and myself. Their kindness helped in establishing trust, which I believe was crucial to our success.

After completing the training program with Asgerk9, Bruce is now much more obedient, responsive, and well-mannered in various situations. He goes absolutely everywhere with us. And the best part is that he understands the program even if it changes.

We had a medical emergency at a restaurant for my son and it was very easy to go from a simple pace to a fast one. Bruce had the understanding of all the commands that he needed to accomplish, especially considering the speed that everything was going at in that moment. The transformation has been nothing short of amazing, and it's all thanks to Asgerk9's expertise.

I wholeheartedly recommend Asgerk9 to any dog owner looking for a skilled and no bs trainer. Whether you're dealing with basic obedience or more complex issues, Asgerk9 has the knowledge and approach to help.

Josh was the massage therapist I worked with during this session and I cannot stress enough how different and individualized his approach was. He started by getting a detailed history of what I was working through and then tailored the entire session to meet my individual needs. I had been going to a chiropractor to get additional relief for a herniated disc I had last year. They had been addressing the structural aspect but I needed some additional work for the musculoskeletal and nerves in the area. This was especially true of the stiffness in my traps, that he recognized almost immediately. He worked all of the muscles and nerves in my upper back and it immediately helped with stress and lack of mobility in the area. He recorded stretches and strength training lifts on my phone so I could continue my recovery at home. I was sore the next day, but I could already feel major relief from the work we completed during our session. Two days after, the soreness from the session was gone, but I had a lot more mobility and almost no pain from the injury.

Even though my mom continue to scream, cry and struggle he continue to push. I am aware that therapies sometimes are rough but at the end of the day they should NOT be forced. She got dizzy from the pain and ever since she has been in pain and extremely swollen. To me it is more than the pain but the fact that the customer service/care for patients was non existent. He did not take 1 sec to check in on her after, explain why he pushed so hard or even take a moment to speak to her.

I immediately scheduled an appointment, which turned out to be a life changing decision. The stabbing back and hip pain that I was experiencing was preventing me from sleeping, walking, playing tennis and working out.
Life was pretty miserable and none of the Orthopedic Specialists who had treated me could offer any other recommendations, short of surgery. This sounds dramatic, but my treatments at Australian Physiotherapy were nothing short of a miracle.  After only 3 appointments with Marrow, I was completely out of pain and shortly back to my normal physical routines.  What a difference this has made in my life!!

Autism ABA Monarch Behavior Analysis LLC - Autism Therapy,(561) 408-3115,ChIJZ0afiy3g2IgRM0NcP1lYd1k,colleen conolly,5,"Before Monarch my whole family was lost on what to do and how to adjust to our new life style when we got the ASD diagnosis for our son. His first half of kindergarten consisted of calls from the school everyday of him lashing out to avoid doing work, which caused him to have 2 suspensions....go figure a kindergartner (5 years old) getting suspended from school. The best decision I made was calling Monarch, who’s team wrapped us in their cocoon to help us develop, learn, and adapt. Personally, I was taught I wasn’t alone in all of this; and I wasn’t! With support at school meetings, together we were able to advocate for my son to attend the right school for him so he can be provided with the support and atmosphere he needed. Fast forward 2 years, with the most amazing, patient therapists, in the most amazing settings, and our son is thriving! They push and encourage him and the end result is always him accomplishing something he didn’t think he could. He has become more independent and self sufficient with his routines; I find I don’t even have to remind him what needs to be done. We are now looking at general education in his soon to be future, because he’s been doing so well in school!
This little boy, who would always cause such a commotion in public that I would get the piercing glares, has now become the role model of how to behave. My husband and I get compliments from friends and family about how far he has come and it makes us feel proud in our choice with Monarch.

Aventura Wellness & Rehab Center,(305) 705-0777,ChIJ__SiLlKs2YgR2I52kYtwhwc,Anonymous Person,1,"I am sharing this review to help other families make informed decisions. Please be cautious with Dr. Greaux. He is not a licensed medical doctor, yet he presents himself in a way that can be very misleading. He has claimed to have trained a well-known spine surgeon at a major hospital in Miami and uses that statement to gain families’ trust. Unfortunately, we have seen patients who, after being treated by him, ended up needing larger corrective surgeries because he gave them false hope and measured radiographs incorrectly.

I explained to the trainer Dewayne my situation and he said to come sit down. He began to ask me questions then decided to take my blood pressure. It was very high.  He checked again and had another trainer checked.  High again. Dewayne and the trainers quickly decided to call in the EMTs.  When they arrived they took my blood pressure which was still very high.
The decision was made to take me to the hospital where my blood pressure read 200/122. Dangerously high. I was admitted and spent a couple days in the hospital before being released home under the care of my doctor.
Dewayne and the trainers made quick decisions that most likely saved me from having a stroke or worse.

The installations are amazing—safe, clean, and ideal for kids. The horses are incredible—gentle, well-trained, and perfect for young riders.

From the very first class, my daughter’s smile and excitement were absolutely priceless. Watching her ride every Sunday is a highlight of our week. The classes are very reasonably priced, actually cheap considering all the added benefits like bilingual interaction, sensory stimulation, beautiful playgrounds, and even a petting farm.

Paulina, her instructor, is a true gem, kind, caring, and incredibly intuitive with children. She gives our daughter personalized attention and treats her with so much empathy and patience that she’s completely won her heart.

Jaime, the manager or owner, is extremely knowledgeable and professional. You can tell he genuinely cares about the experience of every client and goes above and beyond to ensure satisfaction.

I had hip surgery and went to BOSH for rehab after some time trying to get over the severe pain. The moment I stepped into that rehab room, Boris Shapiro, was all over me with insults. ""I can't believe how much pain you're in"". ""I don't know what to do with you"". ""why did you want for so long"". ""Why don't you go home for 2 months and let your leg fall off"". etc etc. He was outrageous. Rude. Unsympathetic. And he kept asking me personal questions about how I made my money. I felt very uncomfortable, under attack and couldn't wait to get out of there.

And although he claimed that the pain I was experiencing was unusual and he recommended I call my doctor, he performed rehab on me while I was in great pain. A good rehab person would have refused to perform rehab and instruct the person to go see their doctor to make sure all was medically good before rehab. And they would not be insulting their client.

Little did Boris Shapiro know that the CUP to my hip implant had fallen out of the socket and was moving around in my hip causing me the great pain. THUS, his belief that my late start of rehab was the cause of my pain was wrong. And his many insults unwarranted. He was unprofessional and a person I would never go back to.

I am now required to have a 2nd surgery to put more screws into the CUP so it doesn't fall out of the socket again.

From the moment I arrived, I was met with genuine warmth and compassion. They didn't just see me as another patient; they saw a person who needed help, and they treated me with dignity and respect every step of the way.
The staff's dedication and expertise are unmatched. The therapists are not only highly skilled but also incredibly empathetic. They created a safe and non-judgmental space for me to work through my struggles, and their guidance was instrumental in my recovery. The nurses and support staff were equally amazing—always available to lend an ear, offer encouragement, or simply provide a comforting presence during difficult moments.
What truly sets this center apart is the staff's unwavering commitment to their patients' well-being. They went above and beyond to ensure I felt supported and cared for, and their positive attitudes were contagious. I am so grateful for their guidance and the tools they've given me to build a healthier, happier life. I highly recommend this center to anyone seeking a place where they will be treated with kindness, professionalism, and genuine care.

My cat’s condition was misdiagnosed, and no additional tests were suggested when the initial treatment failed.
After three weeks of frequent visits and costly treatments, my cat had to be euthanized after 3 days at the ER. During this difficult time, NO ONE from BSAH bothered to reach out to show support or concern during his stay at the ER, or after. My heart is broken. How could a vet be so heartless? Pets are family, and for many of us, our children. Clearly, they seem primarily focused on money, overlooking the importance of empathy.
I have since met others who have had similar experiences. While some may have had positive experiences here, I was personally shocked by the lack of compassion and follow-up. I expect BSAH will respond defensively, but I strongly suggest they ignore me just as they did before and after my cat passed.

And Liz always watched closely to ensure I was doing exercises with proper form. She is a gem and a real lifesaver! Coach Katy Hutcherson is absolutely amazing as well. The pt therapists there are brilliant, and I am grateful to get to work with Dr. Jenna and Dr. Dillon. Occasionally they give wonderful free seminars there, and at two of them I raised my hand at the end to sincerely thank them for offering such superior pt which seeks to address the root issue, and tremendous fitness training, and to say how much they are helping me. Each time, people in front of me enthusiastically turned around and said, ""Same here! This place saved me!"" I wrote them a card once that said their name could also be ""Love in Motion"", because that is what they truly do, by helping restore our strength and function with such expertise, and with such kindness and graciousness.

Back To Health Physical Therapy,(954) 565-0075,ChIJsTYMhvkB2YgRhGqkFf74nPk,H H,5,"After my bilateral mastectomy, I started searching for physical therapy that focused on breast cancer patients, but it was surprisingly hard to find someone who specialized in this type of recovery. I discovered Back To Health because of reviews mentioning post-surgery shoulder/arm therapy, and it turned out to be exactly what I needed.

When I first came in, I was facing a deadline: in order to begin radiation treatment, I needed to achieve a certain level of arm mobility. It felt overwhelming, but Mindy guided me every step of the way. Through her expertise and encouragement, I was able to meet that requirement in time.

I still have a lot of work ahead of me, but I’m very happy with my progress so far with Mindy’s help. She understands the unique challenges breast cancer patients face after surgery, and she approaches therapy with both knowledge and compassion.

And yoga with Bill is a delightful bonus! It’s a welcoming class that makes stretching and strengthening feel doable, even for me, just over 3 months after my surgery.

I’m truly grateful for the care I’ve received at Back To Health.

Back To Work Physical Therapy - South Tampa,(813) 333-2694,ChIJVWyaI8_cwogRaykdPj_VmUg,Sebastian Bejarano,1,"5-Star Review for Sarah and Garrett:

I cannot recommend Sarah and Garrett enough! Their expertise and dedication helped me recover to full duty ten times faster than I ever expected. Their personalized approach, encouragement, and professionalism made all the difference in my healing journey. Thanks to them, I feel stronger and more confident. Truly exceptional top notch professionals.

1-Star Review for Management:

Unfortunately, my experience with the management was disappointing. Due to overbooking and scheduling issues, I often felt I didn't have enough one-on-one time with Sarah and Garrett. This made it difficult to get personalized attention and could have impacted my recovery. I hope they can improve their scheduling to better support both clients and therapists in the future.

I've also observed that Sarah and Garrett are truly dedicated professionals whose quality of care significantly contributes to the success of the practice. If it weren't for their commitment and expertise, the overall quality of service would potentially suffer. However, they often seem overworked and under significant pressure, which may impact their well-being and the high standards they set. Addressing workload would not only support these valuable team members but also ensure the continued excellence of the practice.

Additionally, I have experienced frustration with the owner's frequent scheduling of himself multiple times a week during the times I needed one-on-one sessions with Sarah and Garrett. These sessions were essential for my recovery to return to full duty, and often, his scheduling limited my access to those personalized times. I believe prioritizing patient-focused schedules and limiting unnecessary disruptions would greatly benefit both clients and the team.",2025-06-10 07:07:48,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXY29B2BiL_hXKIIwAbbOmFwOXEOWOXpJpqD2Y69fZw0bSeLxM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:00:39.606106,,

They may have technical competence, but the way they treat clientele is subpar. The communication is poor. They use any and all opportunities to add charges and, as in my case, don’t tell you until afterwards. If using their breeding services, they charge $51 each visit for a “breeding management recheck fee” that is supposed to include vitals. Keep in mind these visits are typically 2 days apart from each other and we went 4 times on one week. They didn’t do any assessment or vitals and the dog never left my sight, just another way to add useless fees. When asked, I was given vague excuses which upon a little research actually mean nothing. They also charge you extra for using credit card as a cherry on top.",2025-03-18 17:11:13,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW6JRxOQ2sEIESAoorN1amf7doTrt7UzmPAdAMYrG36Z0wjjb3f=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:00:43.970929,,
Bannerman Pet Care,(850) 893-2043,ChIJGW48oPVX7IgR041RfS13r2o,José J Rincón,5,"We cannot say enough good things about Bannerman Pet Care! During the last hurricane to hit Florida, our family had to evacuate from Tampa Bay to Tallahassee with our senior dogs. It was a last-minute decision, and we didn’t have our dogs' vet records with us, which became a challenge when we looked for a place to bathe them before staying with family. Every groomer and vet we contacted required these records, but Bannerman Pet Care was different. After explaining our situation, they checked with Dr. Lynda Thabes, who kindly agreed to help.

The team at Bannerman was incredibly compassionate and went above and beyond to accommodate us. Not only did they do a wonderful job bathing and brushing our dogs, but they also showed genuine concern for our situation and well-being. It might seem minor, but having our dogs freshly groomed relieved us of stress during an already difficult time. Their willingness to help out strangers in need speaks volumes about their dedication and kindness.

If we lived in Tallahassee, Bannerman Pet Care would be our go-to vet without question.

This one here is strictly for my BHT's hands down they are the best and they say a good team starts from the head down and you see that operating here Rachel does a phenomenal job managing her staff and making sure that we are treated the way we're supposed to be treating she's even on the floor talking to the clients making sure that our needs are being met when we put something in the suggestion box it's not just thrown away if she can do it it gets done then we have her lead text Keisha and Steven two of the most awesome people I have ever met Keisha has saved a lot of people's lives with her words of wisdom a encouragement. Steven is just funny and on his shit!! Miss Pam gives a lot of love and Yolanda will help you with whatever she can in real time she's not one of those staff that say okay I'm going to do it and you never see her again. Then we got my dog chill Will he going to do his job and joke with you at the same time. Greg is cool. And you got to love Donnie he is a sweetheart and also will do anything for you that he can. Cody is great on the night shift. Lena is cool 2.. there are two other ones that I don't know their names the white lady that work in the morning time and the big dude that work at night also awesome staff.
I appreciate the way they let me grow at my own pace and although I do my treatment a little unorthodox they still notice the changes that I was making and I appreciate that.

I had already bought a brace at CVS which worked well to stabilize/ straighten my thumb. My orthopedist suggested I get a custom skin colored brace - I didn’t want to invest a lot of money on this as I said o had already bought a brace at CVS. After my initial evaluation with Josee I asked her to run it through my insurance and also asked her for an estimate. She said it wouldn’t cost more than ‘a few hundred’. Someome from rehab later called me to say it was approved and to come in for an appointment. I got fitted for a brace which was extremely uncomfortable and painful and I could not wear it more than 2 hrs. I came back to see Josee and as she said she didn’t have time to make a new one we did some hand exercises. She said she would order a thinner material for a new brace that would be more comfortable. I came back 2 weeks later to get fitted and the material had not arrived so I rescheduled the appointment. Next time around I got fitted for the new brace with the new material. I must say I was disappointed in how this brace looks. While it’s slightly more comfortable it’s still more uncomfortable than my CVS brace and it looks like a 10 year old made it in arts and crafts class. Two weeks later I get a bill for $738 for this ‘brace project’ . I was shocked especially when Josee assured me it wouldn’t cost more than a ‘few hundred ‘ which in my mind is $200 tops, especially for a piece of plastic sheeting melted in a hot water bath that took 20 mins to make. The initial eval
should have been $35, the one session where I did exercises also $35. These are my insurance copays. All in I didn’t expect to pay more than $270 for this. I’ve contacted Josee as surely someone must have made a mistake and she told me to call billing. When I talked to billing they told me contact rehab. So here I going in circles. This is the second time Morton Plant overcharges me for a procedure and doesn’t give me an accurate estimate. Next steps are the AMA, the consumer protection board, the Florida Department of Health and if needed, small claims court. Frankly the over billing at Morton Plant has to stop.

Bauser's Pet Training,(305) 454-0420,ChIJI29u3put2YgRxC0TzncbXyw,Daniela M,5,"This is a detailed review, but I promise it’s worth the read! About four months ago, I found Bailey on the streets and decided to adopt him. He’s 6 years old and was incredibly sweet and friendly with both dogs and people when we first took him in. However, after he was neutered, Bailey became reactive and aggressive toward other dogs, both on and off leash.

We also learned that Bailey had been living on the streets for a long time and had been abandoned multiple times, which meant he came with some emotional baggage. He struggled with severe separation anxiety, barking for hours when left alone, which led to frequent complaints from our neighbors. Since Bailey goes everywhere with me, the thought of starting a new job and leaving him at home alone left me feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I couldn’t even consider doggy daycare because I was terrified he might get into a fight with another dog.

I was completely overwhelmed—having no experience training a dog, I didn’t know where to start. After countless hours searching for affordable options that combined daycare and training, I finally found Bauser’s.

In just over a month, Bauser’s has transformed life for both me and Bailey. I was initially hesitant to leave him there because I wasn’t familiar with the staff or how things worked, but my worries disappeared after his first day. The team at Bauser’s is incredibly patient, kind, and attentive to both Bailey’s needs and my concerns.

Bailey has already made tremendous progress, especially around other dogs. Bauser’s provides daily report cards detailing what Bailey worked on, areas for improvement, and tips for practicing at home. They also share videos of his training sessions, showing me how to continue the lessons myself. They’ve even started carefully introducing Bailey to other dogs, which has made a huge difference in his behavior outside of daycare.

Most importantly, Bailey loves it there. He’s always so excited when we arrive, and just the other day, he didn’t even want to leave!

His journey is far from over, but I’m beyond thrilled with the progress he’s made so far.

We noticed a huge improvement in behavior at home, and the social skills our pup has gained are priceless.

What sets Bayard Kennels apart is their personalized attention. They take the time to understand each dog’s personality and needs. You’re not just dropping off your pet—you’re leaving them with people who treat them like family.

But I can honestly say that the growth I’ve experienced in the time I’ve been working with Alexis has been profound. From the very beginning, she brought a level of empathy and presence that immediately made me feel safe, heard, and respected. She never rushed my process, yet always encouraged it.
One of the things I value most about working with Alexis is her ability to hold space while also challenging me. She doesn’t just affirm what I say she helps me unpack it, explore it, and, when necessary, question it. That ability to offer a new lens has helped me uncover blind spots I wouldn’t have found on my own. It’s NOT always comfortable but it’s always in service of growth.
Her perspective has also helped me zoom out and consider the bigger picture in moments when I’m stuck in my own head. Whether it’s relationships, past trauma or bad patterns I’ve repeated unknowingly, Alexis has a way of connecting the dots that makes everything click!
That insight has been invaluable to my journey.
I leave every session feeling more grounded, more clear, and more empowered. Therapy with Alexis hasn’t just helped me cope it’s helped me evolve.

They reached out to me quickly, and from the very first call, I was impressed. Chelsea at the front desk should be the gold standard for customer service. Her phone etiquette, professionalism, and genuinely warm personality immediately put me at ease. Walking in a bit nervous, she made the check-in process smooth and stress-free.

I was paired with Dominick for my sessions, and he continued that same high level of care. He greeted me with professionalism and kindness, took the time to listen, and explained everything he was going to do in a way that made sense. He was patient, moved at a pace I was comfortable with, and made sure I felt confident each step of the way. One thing I especially appreciated was that they created a personalized exercise program just for me - and gave me access to it through their H2 Health app. Having everything right at my fingertips has made continuing my therapy at home so much easier.

On a later visit, the office was noticeably busier, but still impressively organized. Despite the increased flow of patients, everyone received attention, and the staff remained upbeat and fully engaged. You can tell how much the team enjoys what they do - every interaction was personal, and they even spoke to  people calling them by name.

The facility itself is super clean, welcoming, and there’s plenty of convenient parking. All in all, Beachside PT offers an outstanding combination of professionalism, personalization, and a truly supportive environment. I’m so glad my doctor referred me here - I feel like I’m finally on the right path to recovery.

Music is outside but controlled by the techs. The massage chairs are nice but there are only 2 that work out of four. People are late to meetings and constantly go in and out plus hardly ever on time. Activities are often canceled. They just hired a person to run activities. Hopefully things will get better.

They all knew before I did that if that death didn’t happen, I probably wouldn’t have stayed sober anyway. There was still much more therapy to be done, and more to learn.
The staff took a genuine care in doing so, and looking back at their clinical process they are nothing short of a power house of a team. I never felt so cared for as a human being by people that just met me. The staff quickly became my family, cheering me on while also taking it extremely serious. They are unapologetically honest, which in my experience is the #1 thing needed in recovery. Many of the things they said to me during my time there still stick with me (a year later) and help me navigate life!
I tell anyone that has a loved one with Substance abuse or mental health issues about beachway.

Beachway Therapy Center | Florida Rehab,(877) 284-0353,ChIJJ2OEv7nf2IgR_nJs0mx4Cms,Kylie Shae,2,"I went to Beachway in the beginning of 2024 because I was dealing with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and their website looked so promising. I loved that it emphasized a holistic approach since I've tried so many medications and none of them worked, just gave me side effects or worsened my symptoms. I had a very high deductible of $20,000 and I was told that would be the only expense that I would receive. However, I got billed later on for labs for $1,400 and also a bill from them for staying in their intensive outpatient housing. When I tried to call to ask them about this because they were basic labs and shouldn't be that expensive, they won't answer the phone or call back. But they sure will answer right away if you're seeking help. Also, when I got to Beachway they had me talk to doctors who prescribed me medications. I really didn't want to take them given my history but I was desperate. The medications didn't help and once I got home I stopped taking them.

I will say that their facility is beautiful and the food is amazing. I did love the therapists but it's not very personalized. It's about a 30-45 minute individual session once a week. It's a lot of group classes that start to get very repetitive the longer you're there for. The trauma program was the most helpful thing and I am really glad that I did that.

Overall, I don't feel like it was worth the money that I spent FOR ME. I wish I would've found a good therapist near me and done more holistic approaches on my own. However, If you or a loved one is going there for drugs/alcohol/even certain mental health situations, I can definitely say it's worth the money. You can't put a price on saving a life.

I just wish they would have been more upfront about how expensive it was going to be and hidden expenses. And the fact that they don't answer the phone about billing questions or call you back just makes it seem like they're greedy.",2025-09-29 11:00:58,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUwjAACBNM_Jwtoc01wFrk6B2Re-DpZaVjaf_2ERC7L6uTE679F=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:01:12.020893,,

I won’t lie and say that I loved every minute of it because I didn’t. A lot of it was very painful, because confronting inner demons is painful. It was a lot of group therapy (especially given how afraid of people I was going in), but they truly helped me gain sobriety and face down my trauma. And they put up with a lot of my crazy behavior while I was going through withdrawals in detox. Like any rehab, you’ll get out of it what you put into it. Surrender to the process for best results. Rehab isn’t a magic wand that makes problems vanish. Rehab gave me the opportunity to accept the ways in which I cause my own suffering instead of blaming everyone around me, while surrounded by professionals who prevented me from hurting myself while my dried out, and helped me identify the underlying causes of my addiction. It will be tough. It will be scary. It will be worth it. I wish I’d gone sooner. The staff there are wonderful and don’t get enough credit.

Thankfully i connected with LoAn and she has been nothing but patient, friendly, and professional throughout the entirety of our journey.  My son was treated in her clinic as well as at his school and it made a world of a difference.  He looked forward to therapy days and had so much fun with the therapy play.  LoAn was very communicative, giving feedback regularly and providing handouts/therapy play that we can incorporate in our home.  My son's behavior, sensory sensitivity, fine motor skills have drastically improved, with teachers also applauding how far he has come.  We discussed LoAn's re-evaluation in comparison to his first evaluation and I am proud to know he has achieved his goals and ready to graduate from OT!

We were able to recognize and see the need for early diagnosis and treatment which I won’t lie, at first felt daunting and overwhelming but somehow God put us right where we needed to be. From the moment I stepped into Behavior Basics, I felt supported, listened to and have always taken comfort in knowing that each day my son is there, he is safe and cared for. For those of you that also have a child on the spectrum any level, trusting someone else with your child is difficult as safety is a huge priority because they do not always understand basic things to keep themselves safe from harm. (Situational awareness, wandering off, etc) I was able to feel confident that he was safe when I dropped him off and when he was receiving therapy with his RBT. I also feel blessed that since day one, I have been able to actively take part in my sons plan of care, learning how to mimic the goals set and am able to continue to teach my son even at home. This was so important to me. I needed help and guidance on how to manage and work through some of the challenges that we’ve faced throughout my son’s life and I have always had that help from my BCBA and RBT’s. The staff has been so supportive and has been helpful every step of the way and we have seen so many positive changes! We feel so thankful and blessed to be a part of a wonderful facility that truly cares for their clients and their families who were probably like me in the beginning, felt lost and in need of guidance and help.

I chose this therapist because they collaborate with my son's new school, and I believe he could benefit from their services. They informed me that they needed to confirm if they could accept my insurance and if they had availability to accommodate my son. Despite making numerous follow-up calls, we struggled to get updates as the responsible person was often unavailable, and our calls were rarely returned. When we did manage to connect, the information provided was insufficient, or excuses were given. I had to visit the office multiple times to push for progress or seek an update. It took them four months to finally inform us that they were unable to accept our medical insurance due to billing setup issues and that they did not have space available to treat my son as they were at full capacity. The communication and handling of this matter were unprofessional.

Owners, staff and therapists are the best at their craft!  Not only are they there for our children but, are always available to assist us parents with whatever help we need.  As the parent of a child on the Autism spectrum, I have experienced highs and extreme lows.  There is an overwhelming feeling of constant uncertainty on this journey.

I have never felt more comfortable around another group of professionals as I feel with them and having my child being left in their care.  I can honestly say that without the therapy they have provided for my girl, we may have been quite distraught at this stage of her life.  She had made great strides!  When she started she was completely non verbal.  Now,  she is minimally verbal, knows some sign language and uses a speech device to help her communicate what she cannot say yet.  They even helped her with potty training,  which I felt was virtually impossible!  This was accomplished with the help of this awesome team!  Her maladaptive behaviors have decreased significantly, especially meltdowns, crying, frustrations and escaping.   This is something to celebrate!  The parent trainings they provide teach us parents and caregivers how to properly approach our children in different difficult situations.

We've seen new therapists added to their team and they are always sure to make sure each new team member is the right fit and going to be the best person for working with the kids who come to them. They're always learning and trying new things to help their kids and clients progress forward.

Every time I came to Florida, I got stronger. In 2020, I happened to be in Orlando when the pandemic hit. Unable to fly home right away, my family decided to stay indefinitely.

When things started opening back up, it was still a scary time for me because of my lungs. But everyone at Believe made sure I felt safe enough to continue therapy. They were such a blessing—a light in uncertain times. That was when my family decided to make Florida our permanent home, and now I not only get to do intensives but also weekly traditional PT.

The benefits have been incredible. My lungs are stronger. I am stronger. I know I call the team at Believe my friends, but really, they are family. They have been part of my journey for over a decade, supporting me in everything—even my biggest (and sometimes wildest) goals, like getting strong enough to ride Guardians of the Galaxy at Disney World.

Bespoke Canine Training,(813) 406-3460,ChIJmzE1-hTP-mARzORELCbo6MM,Nathaniel Acio,5,"I cannot recommend Estivin enough! I brought our 4-year-old Rottweiler, Teemo, to him for a month of board-and-train, and the results have been nothing short of life-changing.

Before, Teemo was reactive on walks—barking and lunging at birds, dogs, people, bikes, and even cars. Walks were stressful, and I honestly doubted if a dog his age could still be trained out of these behaviors. I worried he might never be able to enjoy public spaces calmly.

During Teemo’s stay, Estivin worked with him daily and took him into real-world environments like malls and Armature Works to desensitize him and teach him how to stay calm around distractions. He trained Teemo to walk politely at my side, stop pulling, and ignore his triggers. Estivin also leveraged some of Teemo's favorite activities, like playing with his ball, to creative positive associations with his surroundings. Estivin also provided me with an e-collar and a cot so I could continue reinforcing the training at home.

What really impressed me was Estivin’s communication and transparency throughout the process. He gave me regular updates with photos and videos, always explained what he was working on, and set clear, realistic goals for each week. I always felt involved and reassured that Teemo was in the best hands.

The transformation has been incredible. Teemo now walks calmly on leash, no longer reacts to everything that moves, and is extremely obedient at home. I was initially nervous that he might come back like a “robot,” but that couldn’t be further from the truth—he’s still the same loving, playful dog, only now he can truly enjoy walks and outings without all the chaos.

Even after the official training ended, Estivin continues to check in, answer my questions, and offer helpful pointers. It’s clear he genuinely cares about the dogs he trains and their long-term success.

My only regret is not bringing Teemo to him sooner. Estivin completely exceeded my expectations and gave me the gift of being able to enjoy life with my dog in a calmer, happier way. I have the utmost admiration for Estivin’s dedication to his craft—his passion, skill, and love for training shine through in everything he does. Truly a master at what he does.",2025-09-23 23:21:03,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLj-UkIrKXDPT9hphgE-hrHKvcZ1jXgY68Ivt8FD7eM9MUt=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:01:25.675025,,

Bespoke Canine Training,(813) 406-3460,ChIJmzE1-hTP-mARzORELCbo6MM,Devaroti Ghosh,5,"Last December, we adopted Blaze, a Malinois X puppy who came with a little bit of extra energy… okay, a LOT of energy. I’ve trained all my dogs myself before, and never had a problem—until Blaze. This guy has a prey drive so strong, I was half expecting him to start chasing his own tail just to see if it moved. At home, he’d listen to commands, but the second we stepped outside, it was like unleashing a Tasmanian Devil. No car, bike, or innocent pedestrian was safe. We actually stopped walking him altogether because we were worried he’d end up hurt.
Enter Estevan from Bespoke Canine, the dog whisperer we didn’t know we needed. With just a few private training sessions, Estevan worked his magic, showing us tools and techniques that made so much sense—it was like a light bulb went off. We followed his instructions to the letter and in just a  month, Blaze is a whole new dog. We can finally walk without fear of him lunging into traffic or trying to drag me into a bush to chase a squirrel. Now, he listens, stays calm, and I don’t need to hold my breath every time a car drives by.

After seeing a podiatrist, an orthopedic surgeon and years of adjustments by a chiropractor, I was directed to Better Life.  Finally I was the one that put the equation together: The right side of my body was severely out of alignment, yet none of the “professionals “ I had seen even considered a body part outside of their area of certification, or that my ailments might be connected! But upon my very first appointment, Dr Corbin assured me that he could help me, and wouldn’t be surprised if I could feel the difference after the first appointment… and he was right on. He told me it was going to take awhile, but I would feel better and I would regain my mobility.

Recommendations:
While our experience has been overwhelmingly positive, I would love to suggest a few improvements:

• Cleanliness: A bit more attention to floor cleanliness and disinfecting would go a long way, especially since this is a medical office where many children come and go throughout the day.
• Parent Comfort: As a parent of a child with unique abilities, we often spend extended periods of time here for multiple therapies. Having a small coffee station or some light snacks available in the waiting area would make a big difference. Many other pediatric therapy offices offer this, and it really adds to the overall comfort and care experience.

Even in a short amount of time, I’ve already seen small wins in my son’s progress, and that means the world to me. I’m truly excited for what’s to come.

Beyond Therapy,(407) 857-6285,ChIJ-5rItC6H3YgRw_X6wOgzfUc,Kyle,1,"I couldn’t even get my daughter into this clinic. We moved to the area from Texas and I was struggling to find an in network provider. I reached out to Beyond Therapy to get my daughter set up for PT, ST, and OT to continue her progress from past clinics. The original call with the Beyond therapy front desk told me they needed insurance info, referrals, notes for past therapists, etc.

I provided the documentation they needed on a Friday and was told they would call me back to set up her initial evaluations/appointments early the next week. I got to the end of the next week and called and they told me they hadn’t processed it and that would hear back the next week. A week later they said the person who processes it went on vacation and that I would hear back the week after.
I called a week after and left voicemails and couldn’t get through. This process continued until I got through to reception. They answered, apologized that they hadn’t gotten back to me and promised a call back. I received no call back and when I tried to call back it went to voicemail.

I was trying to do the best I could for my daughter and this clinic was close to where we were living and was in network. They seemed to make no effort to update me on the progress of reviewing her paperwork or the status of getting my daughter scheduled. I ended up finding a clinic that was farther away but was very responsive and they got my daughter set up with her evaluations that same week.

The lack of responsiveness was very frustrating and made everything more stressful. My wife and I were already stressed about moving and then we also have a daughter with developmental issues and getting her set up in a new place with new insurance was tough to do. Beyond therapy did not help at all. Months after starting therapy at the other clinic I finally got a follow up email from Beyond Therapy asking for my number which was the first time I had heard from them in months. Again, not responsive or helpful and their lack of care in helping us when we were in a tough spot showed me how much care they put into running their clinic. Glad I found one that is responsive to help my daughter reach her developmental goals.",2025-06-12 16:55:51,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIo7r6KawgXrhkykS-k2OKDdFK9Qr2H1whAequPVzmOXvxS0w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:01:30.959059,,

You will first hope they follow due process to get the necessary steps completed to get your child on there calendar.

Beyond the Leash Dog Training,(407) 872-9121,ChIJxwspSSJd54gRDmv1F1r64CU,Daniela Wertheim,5,"We are so grateful for Beyond the Leash!

As first-time dog parents, we honestly didn’t know what to expect, but joining Beyond the Leash has been one of the best decisions we’ve made for our puppy, Ollie.

We’ve taken two classes so far (Puppy 101 and Pawsitive Beginnings) and the growth we’ve seen in Ollie has been amazing. He’s more confident, eager to learn, and we’ve grown just as much alongside him. We feel so much more equipped to understand and meet his needs, thanks to what we’ve learned.

Puppy 101 was the perfect introduction to life with a dog. Kim, the owner, is incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. She helped lay a strong foundation, not just for Ollie, but for us as dog parents. We walked away understanding what it truly takes to raise a happy, fulfilled pup.

Pawsitive Beginnings with Rachel has taken things to the next level. Rachel is such a thoughtful, encouraging trainer who clearly loves what she does and it shows. Ollie lights up every time he sees her, and we love watching his confidence grow in every class.

On top of that, Ollie also attends their day camp, and I have never seen him so excited to go anywhere. The whole team clearly loves and cares for each dog like their own. Every time we drop him off, we know he’s in amazing hands.

A special shoutout to Rachel and Amanda, who adore our boy and make him feel so loved. Their kindness, patience, and genuine passion for what they do make such a difference.

We truly can’t recommend Beyond the Leash enough. Whether you’re brand new to dog parenting or looking to deepen your bond with your pup, this is the place.

Big Bend Physical Therapy,(850) 583-6886,ChIJTYTHrYF3UIwRmGl7tA7xYZk,Matthew Kaplan,5,"Gabe is really more than just a PT - he is a spinal alignment & mobility coach. I've been seeing Gabe for a few years now, he's helped me work back from a number of Spinal and nerve related Ski and Mountain Biking Injuries. When I had a concussion, Gabe mobilized the Fascia around my cranium/skull to loosen nerve endings and help me get back to normal brain function. I felt immediate head relief as I left Gabe's office and could not have gotten back to 100% without that treatment.

Gabe not only is an absolute pro at mobilizing your joints, his ability to recognize a pattern and diagnose an imbalance is second to none. With Gabe, I get vital stability exercises and alignment techniques which many do not have the skill or knowledge to target. When I have a fall or over-use injury, he finds a way to mobilize and help me work through it, as opposed to being sidelined. Since I've been seeing Gabe, I no longer look at injuries as sidelining or adverse experiences, I see them as an opportunity to learn about my body and get stronger.

Gabe's approach to physical therapy is nuanced, and customized to how your body is feeling on that given day. It is rare to find a Physical Therapist who is A) willing to listen to your body's feedback and introduce gentle, nuanced treatment but also B)
can provide strong, pressure point and fascia treatment that will have you mobilized (and maybe a little sore) the next day.

Big Bend Physical Therapy,(850) 583-6886,ChIJTYTHrYF3UIwRmGl7tA7xYZk,P Komor,5,"Gabe has my highest recommendation – he is an incredible physical therapist!  I have seen him for a couple of years at his prior location, and will miss him a lot!  I’ve seen him for a wide variety of issues, and he did a great job with all of them.  I’ve had lots of issues due to a chronic illness, and later being hit on the ski hill.  Gabe has helped me get better and has given me things to do so that I can help with my own healing.

Gabe makes sure that he understands the issue before he begins treatment - he is super smart and thoughtful, and his knowledge of anatomy is impressive.  I think that his experience as a professional dancer gives him a greater understanding of the body and how all of it works together, and how pain in one area might actually be related to an issue in another area.  He does not just think about one small area – he considers anything that might be related to the issue to develop a treatment plan that is effective.

While Gabe is a fantastic therapist, another huge benefit to being Gabe’s patient is that you get to interact with Gabe.  There’s something really special about who Gabe is as a person – he creates an environment that is calming and conducive to healing. Gabe listens carefully, has a thoughtful and effective approach to treatment, and cares about his patients.

I dance many hours a week, and have participated in local and national competitions. When I have been injured, or am in pain from overuse, Gabe has been there for me. Gabe could always figure out what I did to cause my issue and how to fix it. Because he is a dancer, Gabe was also able to help me in ways that no other therapist has been able to do - he knows dance so well that he could help me figure out how to adjust the way I was doing certain dance moves to avoid re-injuring myself. He understands exactly what parts of the body should be used for certain moves, and helped me understand that, so I could improve the safety and quality of my dancing for the future.

I also enjoyed getting to know Gabe as he worked on me. He is a very cool guy who is supportive, easy to talk to, and creates a space where anyone can feel comfortable. I know that Gabe genuinely cares about me, and even though he has moved to Florida, I look forward to staying in touch with him!

The therapeutic riding lessons are carefully designed to promote physical, emotional, and cognitive growth, while fostering a sense of connection and joy. The staff's dedication, compassion, and expertise are truly inspiring, making a lasting difference in the lives of participants and their families.

What sets Bit-By-Bit apart is its commitment to providing a nurturing and inclusive environment, where individuals can grow, learn, and thrive. The center's passion for equine-assisted therapy is evident in every aspect of their work.

The VA approved my equine therapy with Bit By Bit in beautiful Davie, South Florida.  I started in November 2024 and fell in love with the program.  The whole program, everything, and everyone are a five-star rating.  The horses are treated with love from everyone (I’m vegan on a spiritual level so this is most important to me and it reflects to all the staff who also LOVE horses!).  I’m also blessed with my timing to have seen the most recent building of their most beautiful arena overhead cover protection roof with huge fans in the ceiling but the location also has a beautiful natural breeze  there as well.  I have to also mention the beautiful location.  It’s seriously like a paradise located far far far away from any traffic or noise.  These horses have it all too.  Beautiful clean and organized stables, and free roaming areas.  Then there’s the staff!  They, and all he volunteers are incredibly kind, graceful, knowledgeable, and respectful.

They also fraudulently billed tricare days after our last day attended on 2/13 through 2/21 and other days that we missed. So beware and Pay attention to billing. Beware how quickly the owner will have an inappropriate attitude towards questioning any issues that your having.  Staff “RBT” would tell me child hit head wouldn’t have a report ready at hand and would deny it  saying fell on butt instead. I believe he was being pulled “forced” falling back from hand being pulled. Not waiting him out.
During SLP/ OT evaluation my child was forced to sit in a desk highly upset and sick with a fever. Blowing bubbles in his face while he was obviously dazed out in a absence seizure or confusion not even relating to me being there. Had a fever that morning and DR note. Ignored it. Kept him for 6 hours with a fever no notice to me crying/ grunting all day. No meds. Within an hour of being home he had tonic clonic episode. Takes days for him to recover. Forcibly want the child there not putting them first. Owner instructed staff to pressure me to leave him even after said he’s sick. Later that night had seizure after not having one for over a year! Started meds and consults and other diagnoses. It was too stressful for him.

I've been coming here now for about 6 months. Through that time she has helped me heal my stomach tremendously, giving me new tools to use every time I see her. She allows me to move at my own pace, she makes me feel confident and comfortable, and listens to me every time I communicate with her.

A year ago I went to numerous doctors, spending too much time trying to figure out solutions, and taking medicines that only made me feel worse. Finally, after going to the Mayo Clinic, my doctor instructed me to find a pelvic floor physical therapist.

After months of excruciating daily pain just from simply drinking a water bottle, I never would have thought that massages, exercises, and yoga would cure me, but here we are.

Now, my stomach pain isn't even my first though in the morning and I'm thankful I've gotten here. There was a time I never thought that would be possible.

Blue Skies Health & Wellness Clinic,(772) 291-5663,ChIJyQO3vh3r3ogR83grLpPEJyE,Danielle Dee,1,"What a disappointment! Called a month ago and was informed that they do not take my insurance. I was confused being their website states they did, so I reached out to them via social media. When they responded I was informed that I was given the wrong information and that they do in fact take my insurance. At that time I was informed that someone from the office will call, they never did. I ended up following up and speaking to the office manager Sara. When I spoke to her she apologized for the miscommunication and told me that they do in fact take my insurance and I was even given Dr.Hamiltons NPI # for my insurance. Today a month later was my appointment for my daughter and I. Took my child out of school early and traveled 30 minutes to the office. We arrived at the office five minutes before my appointment to be informed from the office manager that they stopped taking my insurance. I asked to speak to Sabrina the owner who was the one that told the office manager that they are no longer taking my insurance, to which Sabrina would not speak to me. Though when I was speaking to the office manager she slipped up on her words and said that Sabrina was not accepting new patients. There is a poor lack of communication from the owner Sabrina to the office manager and front staff. I waited a month for this appointment for them to completely drop the ball. The owner Sabrina should have came out from the back to address the situation instead of putting it on her office manager Sara. Very sad this is what the health industry has come to, complete negligence and no care for patients.

You as the owner did not even have the consideration to come to the front to speak with me. My daughter and I both had appointments scheduled that we waited a month for. It has nothing to do with system transition. It had to do with the incompetence of you as the owner deciding two weeks before our appointments to no longer accept new patients. You as the owner should has told your office manager to reach out to patients to let them know you are no longer taking new patients. You agreed to see us for what? To just bill the insurance company that you supposed on no longer take. If you no longer take it, you wouldn’t be able to bill for it. You are getting caught in your lies and it’s very sad as a vet and a professional that you would act like this and not accept your fault as an owner.

I was referred to him for chronic pain. I do not get along with psychologist but I accepted the offer to at least hear him out. So I did.
The initial appoint was basically the norm of getting to know each other patient to doctor and vise versa. I was fully expecting to fire him immediately. You see, I'm a combat vet with alot of issues, lol. Dillon's approach to the first meeting led me to be intrigued and since 2021 I see him once a week and just learning stuff from him about my head.
In Dec 2021 Dillon realized I was an extremely bad alcoholic and bought up the idea of a rehabilitation facility for alcoholics. I said ""heck no"". But went insane one night and Dillon did his as always ""Over The Top"" burning the midnight oil, Dillon magic. He got me to where I needed to be to tackle my mental well being from a place of sobriety and I can never thank him and Blue Sky enough. I am sober now for over a year, loving it and not looking back. Thank You Dillon, I owe you my life.

There are a lot of other more professional and experienced rehab centers for healthcare professionals. The experience I had over more than three months was subpar to say the least. It's hard to even call this place a rehabilitation center. The Hardens (John and Elizabeth) who run the place you'll never see in person while you are there. If you are a physician referred by a PHP or other state physician health program like South Carolina RPP, they will most likely keep you over 90 days regardless of what they tell you from the beginning. Expect a lack of transparency and inadequate programming. The cost is $17k/month, which is cheaper than other rehabs. They do not provide food though they do provide housing. You sit in sessions from 8-2:30pm every day that are taught by barely competent therapists who often have you read aloud from printouts. They scratch the surface of topics like DBT/CBT/recovery. They have basically two therapists who run your sessions with occasional visiting lecturers who spitball topics in recovery. I found most of these sessions useless. You have weekly ""art therapy"" where you draw on paper with markers and do meditation sessions to start out your mornings. You have a once a week therapy session with your assigned counselor who projects on you what they think your problem is from the start. The staff don't prepare much for your sessions, and you sit in the same room everyday with a small group of men/women between 8-20 people. You have to rely on fellow rehab clients for transportation since the living quarters aren't close enough to the center or ""coaches"" that they employ. They take your technology/phone away for the first 1-2 weeks then give it back which is better than other places. You attend daily AA or NA meetings in the evenings in the area and have a little time to workout if they let you between 3pm and 6pm. You don't have much to do on the weekends except go to meetings and volunteer in the morning on Sunday at a soup kitchen for the homeless. They drug test you weekly randomly then charge you for it later. You see a psychiatrist and a NP once a week who gaslight you about discharge dates. When you leave, you typically have to do a weekly remote alumni zoom meeting for which they charge you $200/month. They take forever to draft your reports and drag their feet during discharge. The discharge process is disorganized and often involves extending your time there. They get angry when you try to get specifics. When you are ready to go it's often with a few days notice leading to expensive last minute travel plans. You fortunately get your own room in the living quarters which is nice, and they do inspect your room/count your pills regularly which is typical of rehabs. They will want you off of any controlled substance even if it is prescribed by your doctor. People got in trouble for having legally prescribed benzos or stimulants. If you test positive for alcohol when you arrive (either breathalyzer or Peth), they put you on a withdrawal protocol with benzos which is poorly monitored and often not evidence based (using a CIWA scale for instance). In summary, there is a pattern of poor programming, poor communication and just poor quality at BoardPrep. It is hard for me to see how any of the reviews are positive.",2025-10-08 18:04:55,in the last week,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLbmzHoNjAuQ4DmwGOXj0kmP-2tz216Kxwkpd3JtC6iVknufw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:01:46.853451,,

Body Mechanics Physical Therapy,(904) 990-4378,ChIJ8frzFIHK5YgR5mNwbHRveLk,Mark Blackman,5,"I wanted to take a moment to thank Dr. Meghan Braun for her guidance and expertise with my son's return-to-play plan.  He is a high school lacrosse player suffered a knee injury just prior to the beginning of last season.  In addition to being concerned about the knee itself, I was also concerned about him missing out of an entire season and being left behind.  After doing traditional PT at JOI I felt that he needed to be involved in lax even though he was not able to to participate in games or practices yet.  After doing some research I could not believe it when I came across the website for Body Mechanics because it was a continuation of PT but with a structured approach to begin strength training again while doing lax-specific lax drills and exercises.  His made a full recovered in time for his summer travel league and has been playing pain-free since then.  As a parent, my biggest concern was knowing what the right amount of training would be.....basically finding that balance between working through an injury vs. doing too much suffering a setback.  We absolutely could not have had the success we did without Dr. Meghan.  In addition to her knowledge, she is an athlete so she understands the difference between playing while not being perfect vs. having an actual problem and how to handle this.  Plus, she is extremely nice!

1) Location and Hours of Operation are convenient… Duval County is huge, but quality care is worth the drive.
2) Scheduling can be done online, which makes rescheduling or canceling efficient.
3) Free Consultation is a huge bonus… You will get clear communication from Dr. Braun about the treatment process and concise answers to questions about your goals.
4) Highly qualified injury expertise… I suffered from Frozen Shoulder. This type of injury is incredibly painful, physically limiting, and takes time to heal properly. Dr. Braun was a multi-faceted PT PRO, using a range of skills to gently and efficiently address dysfunctions in my neck, back, arm, and shoulder, to calm inflammation, reduce pain, and get ease of movement back into my whole body.
5) It’s a collaboration… Dr. Braun has written a series of books that enhance the healing experience through personal journaling. Not only did this help keep me motivated, it managed expectations, supported me emotionally, and addressed mental blocks. As a client, I felt very empowered by this tool, and much more invested in my rehab outside of treatment visits with Dr. Braun.
6) Trust. I had an intricate injury, plus pre-existing conditions that made my case (at times) complex. I never lost faith that my shoulder would return to optimal function and I could relax, and believe in that because Dr. Braun is honest, and forthcoming about all aspects of treatment.

Lastly, I felt comforted and supported on my difficult days, and during periods when progress was slow… physical therapy can be tough, Dr. Braun stayed invested and committed to providing the best outcome for me, I am so grateful.

To be honest, I was expecting just a typical physical therapy place, where they give you exercises and barely check on you—but what I received here was completely different.

Angie and Nathalie were my occupational therapists throughout the entire process, and I couldn’t have asked for better care. They were genuinely invested in my recovery, constantly making sure I was improving, both in-clinic and at home.

I had a flexor tendon and nerve repair done on my index finger, and the location of the original cut made recovery very challenging. But thanks to them, I’m now fully recovered and able to use my finger like I used to.

They went above and beyond, spending extra time with me during appointments to work on scar tissue, mobility, and strength. They never let me slack because they were fully committed to helping me get back to normal.

Brevard Spay/Neuter Clinic,(321) 724-1141,ChIJE97GYRYT3ogRl9fEdLO2XQ0,Savitri Balram,5,Very well organized and thoughtful clinic with helpful and pleasant staff. Very easy to make an appointment with reasonable prices. We brought in a mom and baby cat to be spayed and neutered. Got there a tad early with forms in hand and was out in 15 minutes. We returned around 4:30 for pickup and got our babies back by 5 pm. We had a onesie for the mom and a neck collar for the baby to ensure they didn't try overly licking their stitches. It's been 5 days since surgery. The clinic called to check on the patients. I'm happy to report both mom and baby are covering just fine. Would highly recommend the folks over at this clinic.,2025-07-22 20:30:29,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUvuYP6DOpASgseBA8EmdkNBFLAa9IH3EgIpIhqXvsNefCYVaQA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6,2025-10-13 18:01:57.441890,,
Brevard Spay/Neuter Clinic,(321) 724-1141,ChIJE97GYRYT3ogRl9fEdLO2XQ0,Jessica Adkins,1,"The prices are unbeatable, & I have yet to experience a *major* issue with my animals here. But the organization & wait times with this place are out of control. Liz used to have this place operating well but it's been worse & worse since she left. Steve is the only one here who seems reliable.
When the surgeries are done I used to get a call to come pick up the dog. Whether 1130am, 2pm, 4pm, whatever. They would integrate pickups thruout the day. Today I received no call. They just always say to be here by 5 when they close. So I got here at 5 and the waiting room was slammed full. Appears that no one got a call today & they planned to have all pickups at once......
I've worked a low cost clinic before & we could do surgery pickups staggered at the end of day & have everyone checked out in 45 mins. But this clinic cant handle that kind of efficiency. I'm sitting here writing this review at 630pm still waiting to check out my dogs in a room full of people!! I was ""on the checkout list"" 1.5hrs ago. They have a sign stating that first come isn't the procedure here & please be patient as checkin/out can take up to an hour. Well today I waited 2 hours to get my 2 dogs & I'm not gonna be coming back to do this ever again. The current staff are completely unorganized. They sat there checking out 20 feral cats 1 by 1 to the regular rescue people that do daily dropoffs, while ignoring every other patron for an hour. A single ounce of organization would tell you that the regular dropoffs should have their own pickup time at the end. AND that anybody ""on the checkout list"" should not be sitting in your lobby 2 hours waiting as every other animal goes home and I sit there in front of your face being ignored. The woman who does checkins & checkouts refuses to make eye contact like she's scared of conflict. She sent another girl out to get me from my car when they were finally ready to check out my dogs. She doesn't have what it takes to run this high pressure position at the front of a fast paced clinic. They're not gonna be able to handle the masses they try & book until they find another Liz.
On the topic of quality of care?.... I have gotten what I expected from a low cost clinic. Some questionable neuter procedures, a heartworm positive dog once that nobody bothered to call & let me know was positive before pickup.... but luckily I've avoided any major issues. While sitting in the lobby for 2hrs waiting to checkout today I heard the receptionist tell somebody that her dog ACCIDENTALLY GOT MICROCHIPPED BECAUSE THE TECHNICIAN GRABBED THE WRONG PAPERWORK! Other ladies in the room started chatting very concerned about ""what else did they mess up back there?!"" And it's just really sad to know that these things happen way more often than the reviews may tell you. I've gotten dogs home before who didn't receive the vaccines I paid for. Simple ""mistakes"" but it's not okay to be happening so often in a medically professional environment... Honestly the neuters I paid for today were pretty concerning! The lady who brought my dogs out to me told me 1 was pretty swollen & the other was ""even more swollen... you definitely need to ice him""
ICE HIM?! I
've never in 12 years of animal work heard anyone advise to ice the incision on a dog. That advice was really concerning as to their staff training & honestly the last straw for me. Nobody there seems to understand how a simple neuter works & it's truly baffling to me how many things they can manage to screw up on a simple simple procedure.",2025-05-25 04:55:07,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7ppZ5v5FkfV892-SiUJhyxNgVUbcVrb4nviXf80ENaJEt-dw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:01:57.441890,,

She was a great resource for us in so many ways, but her advanced training in a wide variety of methods of treating all the different issues in Speech Pathology such as receptive/expressive language disorders and dyslexia was the main reason we sought her out. After trying several different speech therapists and making little to no progress, we decided to make the drive an hour or more each way to see Cara. We did this for a little over a year and it was worth it. We have had significant progress since starting with her.  We are still on the journey, but therapy with Cara got us ahead leaps and bounds and now we know we are on the right track.

She is now in kindergarten and is confident in herself and her speech, and has not had communication issues thanks to Bridge Therapy and all the hard work they have poured into my child.
The best thing I have ever done for my child, is put her in Bridge Therapy and trust in their process!! Their knowledge, skills, and kindness go far beyond any therapy office we have been to before!

Brightside Therapy LLC,(407) 452-9651,ChIJHaxir3dz3YgRyNdoyZdrn38,Fiorelin,1,"Update.-
Don't make this about your company, that you take pride on this and that. Her maternity leave is not in discussion, I'm a mother of two and I totally understand and that is why we were loyal to her waiting 4 months, I even sent another referral for OT by e-mail and I didn't get a reply or call from any of you.
This is about a 2 years old that needs therapy and I sabella was careless, selfish, she made everything about herself, she pointed the issue about her family needs but didn't care about my son's needs and we waited for her, what was she talking about?. Shame on her for discharging my son right after I asked for more often therapy sessions, to a therapist, instead of being professional, polite, caring, respectful with her patients, she could have let another therapist take over BEFORE and not after she's back. She made us wait and then discharge my kid without any consideration. I think she just took things personally and sent my son away because she didn't like we couldn't adjust to her schedule. Otherwise, how would you explain her behaviour?

I didn't know I was on ""will call"", I had to ask by text mesaages the week before for dates available the following week.

Lastly, you made a call AFTER I received the discharge letter. Why? So you can have  on record  that your company made the effort?
Again, I don't think you treat my son fairly, equally. My son lost 4 months of his life plus another few months looking for another therapist. Never felt so mistreated.
That is my experience with Brightside Therapy.

---------

Isabella seemed to be nice and respectful but once you can't adjust to her schedule she will show her true colors.
In all sessions I never received a summary of what she's done in that day with my son, just vague comments. I just kept thinking is normal till my son start saying words.

She never said how long she'd be gone for maternity leave, I thought we had to stick with her so we actually ended up waiting 4 months.
Once she's back she texted me asking when I'm available and I said: 'Please, the sooner the better, any time, any day'. And then suddenly she texted me again 2 hours before a session was cancelled and I said no, it doesn't work for us. She didn't actually set sessions for us that week, she was trying to cover that spot with my son so I said politely: 'I feel like we are not getting very often sessions' and she just discharged my son just because we couldn't adjust to her schedule, after we waited for her 4 months so now my little one now has to wait another few months because there's a waiting list everywhere.
Isabella was very unprofessional and disrespectful, made everything about herself and her family, she even said doesn't appreciate people not understanding her family needs which makes no sense coming from someone very unprofessional, had zero consideration with my son who needs help and had zero emphaty for others.  My son was the patient here, not her.
I do not recommend Brightside Therapy at all, no one else reached out to me to set appointments when she was out, I even sent another referral, after months she said she received it but I never got an e-mail back, it's very dissapointing and unfortunate that this place it's still on business because they clearly need to improve the way they treat their patients. We felt very mistreated by them.",2023-08-31 13:53:51,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLfh3e0pBd26sLrDLv2Ju_2khYloyGC1Ev3wR2dC0ystlLuCA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:02:06.839132,,

They pretend to care and be a ""people first"" company with a ""work life balance"" culture, yet they let me go due to emergencies and hardships that they knew about prior to hiring me. Even though I'm a skilled, experienced RBT who has communicated every step of the way. I wouldn't cover for them during my first week of training in a completely different center because I didn't have safe navigation, so they counted each of those against me. I had to leave mid day because we were facing an eviction and they just drop me the very next day.  How cruel and inhumane. Not even the common decency of a conversation, like ""hey we noticed this - whats going on? How can we support you?"" Nothing. They expect everything from you with no flexibility or support in return. They were going to make me work an entire day for them pretending that everything is fine so ill do a good job just to fire me at the end of my session. Aparently I wasn't one of the favorites, so I wasn't even worth the time of day. Overall terrible experience. The kids are just piled up ontop of each other, the center is loud, they are not equipt for safety and maladaptive crisis behaviors, they give you no proper training for central reach, and they are way under staffed in management.

After 29 days in inpatient therapy and two months of in home therapy, I thought that I’d shown as much growth as I would.  But, Mary and Michelle came into my life!  Good cop (Michelle) and bad cop (Mary).  After a few visits, I was told, by the bad cop, not to bring my wheelchair back. I remember crying when she showed me that I could walk without feeling my feet.  Mary was relentless; showed no pity but demonstrated lots of compassion.  When I worked with good cop, Michelle, I soon found out that her sweet persona in no way interfered with determination to make me achieve my goals.  I am always impressed by their intense focus on everything I do.  I learned quickly that therapy begins as soon as I was greeted.  If I didn’t stand from the seat correctly, I had to do it over.  If I didn’t position myself properly in the walker, I was immediately corrected. Mean cop even made me open the door for myself.  When I snitched to Michelle about Mary making me open the door, she made me do it too.  Great teamwork;  both focused on helping me get better.  I appreciate that that both of my therapist observed closely and adjusted therapy accordingly.  I love that they explained what they were doing and why.  I’m grateful that they never tired of my (and my husband’s) many questions.  Mary and Michelle and the entire staff are remarkable.  From the warm greeting from Dee when you enter Brooks until you leave an hour later, I felt respected and genuinely cared for.

Brooks Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic - Ortega,(904) 483-2272,ChIJlccL5NHH5YgRmPAAbEeLHNo,Kathlene Lei Ruiz,5,"After aimlessly navigating over a decade of being misdirected, discouraged and disappointed with the “care” I’ve received from numerous health care providers, I finally have been guided in the right direction. I have struggled endometriosis and pelvic floor dysfunction for as long as I can remember.
I was referred by my surgeon to see Marie Bogh at Brooks a few months after my laparoscopic excision. At the time, I was experiencing long-term discomfort and developed new symptoms after surgery including urinary problems. At first, I was extremely skeptical and honestly, I was already running low on hope and had little belief in myself. However, through working with Marie over the last few months, I have done a 180. Not only has she helped me physically, but she has taught me more about my condition in a way that didn’t leave me feeling hopeless. In fact, I feel empowered.
If you are thinking about trying pelvic floor therapy, please do yourself a favor and give it a shot. I know it can be scary. I was so close to not giving them a call because I didn’t believe that it could help but it has been life changing. I feel so grateful to have found Marie, especially after dealing with so many cold and dismissive providers in the past. She is empathetic, patient, and a great listener. Usually, I hate going to any type of doctors appointment but I didn’t dread going to pelvic floor therapy. I looked forward to seeing what I could improve on and see how much I’ve progressed at every session. Marie is knowledgeable and also kind and it felt like talking to a friend. This type of therapy can be really uncomfortable with the wrong person but it wasn’t awkward at all. She always remains professional and never crosses boundaries.
Pelvic floor therapy is such an intimidating thing to take on especially if you experience pain and/or have trauma. But Marie is understanding and I grew to trust her and she didn’t ever once push forward with anything that I was uncomfortable doing. Be ready to put in physical and mental work. She will push and encourage you in a motivating way. You’ll be surprised with what you accomplish with her help. That’s also something I learned: it’s okay to ask for help.
Now that I understand more about my body, I have the power and tools necessary to move forward with my life even after being discharged. Coming here has been such a positive experience and all of the staff are so kind and welcoming.

I especially appreciated the teaching aspect of my sessions and the graphics to follow for my in home exercises.  They were very kind to print them to be used at home.

I appreciated the explanations of the progress i could reasonably expect if i followed the daily exercise directives.  Throughout my treatments I was able to see progress in my ROM , sometimes only slight progress but overall at the conclusion of my treatments,  a very big improvement in my ability to perform the activity that i normally do.

Our experience with Brooks has been life changing. I'll start by saying I have a very neuro diverse household. Four of my children have been in the doors of this facility. We've done it all... speech , PT and OT. It has been very meaningfull for all of my children but especially my littlest one who has ASD. The care he has received here has improved not only his life but the life of our entire family. What I have learned in my time coming to Brooks with my children has made me a better parent. The parent education portion of their care has given me a much better toolbox for handling what comes my way. I have learned so much about how to help my children from proper hand writing skills and how to pronounce the letter R to bigger life challenges like sensory issues, learning how to fall safely , and how to help a child who is completely diaregulated find peace again. When I came with my youngest I honestly wondered more days than not how I was going to simply make it through my day. Those days still happen sometimes, but they are much less frequent and now when they do happen I know I can handle them because my toolbox is well equipped.

The entire team was fantastic. The office staff kept everything running smoothly and on time, and everyone was friendly and professional. I learned so much about my torn rotator cuff—how to heal, strengthen, and manage it going forward. The experience was not only effective but empowering.

C.H.O.O.S.E. Physical Therapy LLC,(727) 797-7600,ChIJKf9xSQ_zwogRd17RAt3MkQU,Brad R.,5,"I was referred to CHOOSE PT by a friend to try their mechanical traction for low back pain caused by herniated discs I suffered in a car accident 6 years ago. Prior to seeking treatment at CHOOSE, I was unable to lift weights  or do strenuous work without risking flare ups and serious pain.

My initial appointment was with Martin and I had just experienced a flare up that morning. Martin did his evaluation and performed a manual release procedure on my Iliopsoas muscle that got me back to functional very quickly.

Follow up appointments with Martin were a combination of physical therapy and mechanical traction. Both of these treatments were instrumental to getting me back to where I am today. Martin showed me techniques for strengthening my core and engaging them while doing weight training.

It has been roughly three months since my last therapy session with traction, and I am able to do most of the weight training exercises I was doing before, and I've been able to do some very physical work in the field at work that would have caused flare ups and pain prior to going to CHOOSE for therapy.

Martin is a brilliant therapist and I can't say enough good things about his practice and how they approach recovery from injuries.

CAP Speech Therapy,(786) 571-5322,ChIJKeTF-lIB2YgRxKMB2w5TVWc,Paolo Meireles,5,"We have nothing but excellent things to say about Melanie and CAP Speech Therapy.  We started working with Melanie shortly after our daughter turned two years old, as she was flagged as having very limited vocabulary at that point.  As new parents, we were very anxious and stressed about the situation.  We worked with several therapist and simply couldn't find the right fit for us.
None of them seemed to be doing much, and certainly weren't working with us to give us tools to help our daughter's progress.
Then we came upon Melanie and CAP Speech.  Melanie took the time to handle all of our (countless) calls and emails, explained the process every step of the way, and always spent extra time with us at each session to give us additional tools and guidance.  It become more about the team effort to help our daughter excel and catch up, and it become effortless to continue the work with our daughter between sessions. And unlike with other therapists, with Melanie we saw the exponential growth in our daughter's speech happen from day to day, week to week.  Melanie really connected with her, understood what she needed, and pushed her at the right pace to make great progress in her language.   Fast forward to now, our daughter won't stop talking (for better or worse, lol).  Our kids love when ""Miss Melanie"" comes over and they rush to give her hugs at the door -- they see her as a member of the family now.  It's going to be bitter sweet when we no longer have her stopping by for her sessions.

ADVICE: Physical therapy is not a ""spa day"", you have to help yourself for them to help you. Expert stretches and targeted exercises are what help you get better. If you don't know what this is about, let them teach you. Don't come with a preconceived notion, thinking that this is a massage and cucumbers on your face because it's not.

They are incredibly responsive to emails or calls and we were very impressed with the thoroughness of our child's evaluations and treatment plan. After each session, your child's therapist will speak with you about what they worked on, what activities they used so you can emulate at home, and your child's progress. They understand the behaviors that Autistic children can present with and meet them where they are at with grace and understanding. Ms. Shirley, Ms. Elizabeth, and Ms. Adrianna have been phenomenal throughout our Speech and OT journey!

I had a dupuytren's contracture surgery and after my finger was hurting a lot and was kind of bent and very stiff, red and swollen. I came in with low expectations and I was suddenly surprised when she showed knowledge and a technique to work on the scar tissue left after surgery. You ask her questions and she has the right and undoubtedly the correct answer. In just 1 session Lydia made my finger better, the sweling is down and the finger moves better and is not crooked anymore. My surgeon is truly very impressed and I am impressed as she proved me wrong and my expectations are now high. I know there is no one in the whole world that's as amazing as she is and as knowledgeable as her. She works hard, is kind, respectful, patient and willing to go above and beyond to help her patients feel better and get better. Lydia is the definition of phenomenal and amazing, truly the best there is. Her passion for her work is shown in the process I made in like I said 1 session and her skills are beyond anyone's I have ever seen. Don't take my word for it, go and find out yourself and ask for Lydia the best hand therapist. Her boss should be impressed with her as everyone is. Thank you to this facilty for having me as a patient and to Lydia for her hard work and for the help she gives me every week.

2. I broke my foot back in December 2024 and in January of this year 2025 I had to do therapy for my foot as it was weak and hard to move the fractured toe and I ended up seeing Beth most of the time and she helped me recover in 2 weeks. I also see her for dry needling  for my hand and lam truly impressed, she has truly phenomenal skills, she is knowledgeable about the procedure and she does it with care and patience. She explains and talks to you, treats you with respect and sincerity, she makes sure you are comfortable and that you are healing properly and that the procedure is working perfect. Beth truly respects and cares for every patient and I am truly thankful to have met this amazing person and therapist and how she has helped me get better in this journey of healing. I know is your job and I can tell you truly care for your patient's well being. Thank you Beth for being truly committed to helping me and everyone who is in your care.

3. Becky is wonderful, she's always so helpful and informative at the front desk. I've had a great experience with her when visiting for hand therapy with Lydia or dry needling with Beth.

I have nothing short of great things to state about the individuals and my appointments experienced at this facility. I imagine that a large number of clients serviced here do not write reviews because they are taken care of which is why you may not see many reviews.

I had torn my ACL and underwent surgery back in late February of 2018. By the third week after surgery I began to undergo physical therapy and did not have the faintest idea as to what that would entail. I recall Ron’s sense of humor, kind personality and welcoming demeanor made my appointments something to look forward to when I was bedridden. I ventured from crutches, to a knee brace and now am able to run freely. Each exercise I was instructed to do elevated my recovery time through muscle strengthening and conditioning.

Towards my fourth and fifth months of treatment, Katie provided me plyometric exercises to improve my cardio and gain more strength in my knee. I was out of breath after each drill but enjoyed the sense of accomplishment when I stretched a little further or was able to do more than I had anticipated on my recovering knee. Every time I thought I had mastered or strengthened a particular exercise – I had the staff here introduce a new one. My desire to recover coupled with the knowledgeable and experienced staff at Cora made this all possible.

There are no shortcuts or fancy machines for recovery (in my opinion) just good ol’ fashioned hard work. Come with a positive mindset, quit complaining about what you can’t do and try! That’s how you get better than you were yesterday. Ron, Katie, and Scott – Thank you endlessly for your insight and care.

First of all, I got shuffled between therapists and none of them took me serious or even focus on getting me better.

One of the male therapists there was so rude to me and just completely ignored me all throughout my session with him. I was pretty much doing my own thing during the session because he was just focusing on his other patient; as if I did not matter.

I always arrived super early and they always called me late to start my session and they did the bare minimum with me. I was not getting the treatment or care I needed there. And some of the staff are fake and racist towards black patients.

I asked to talk to a manager to raise my concerns and they literally had me talked to a therapist instead. Most of the staff there are Hispanic; so they mostly nice to Hispanics and white patients and not so much towards blacks.

Kendall drive and everything improved! From my first evaluation with Laura and Martha telling me to start without my recently prescribed AFO, because there was still a lot I could rehabilitate- to the subsequent months of physical therapy with Alex, Ronald, Marta alternating with occupational therapy with Liz- I stopped relying on my cane, improved my balance and also my overall outlook on what’s still possible. I continue to be impressed with their care and dedication to all the patients I have watched improve from strokes, fractures, falls, accidents and debilitating arthritis since I started. Walking in each time and being greeted by their friendly front desk staff and assistants feels so welcoming.  It  makes the unfortunate circumstances that brought me there feel easier to overcome.

I am so glad that I chose this location, and that Kelly was the one who helped me. Today was my last appointment, and honestly, I almost wanted to cry (in a positive way!) because I will miss her. She is really sweet, caring, and attentive.

Since I wasn’t used to physical therapy, I was worried that I would not be confident enough to voice my questions or concerns, but with Kelly, I actually felt safe and heard in every appointment. She constantly checked in on me, made sure I was comfortable with each exercise, and truly listened whenever I was in pain or uncertain about how to do an activity.

She also gave me advice on affordable, practical ways to continue the therapy exercises at home, which I am very grateful for. I just wish I could have Kelly as my doctor for everything, lol.

I’m graduating from therapy, but I’ll definitely miss seeing her and might stop by just to say hi.

CORA Physical Therapy Lauderhill,(954) 746-7230,ChIJKZF8ft4F2YgR81-0STG_GkM,Maurice Pierre,5,"I recently injured my MCL, but luckily did not require surgery. Instead, I got a prescription for physical therapy. I needed to find a good place that was relatively close to my house, but also took my insurance. The doctor provided a list of therapists, and this CORA location worked out perfectly.
I was able to get a next-day appointment for my evaluation. They tested the limits of my knee to see my range of motion and strength level and then provided a list of exercises that I could do on my own at home. These exercises were also available for me on their customized MedBridge app. The app shows how to do the exercises and you can follow through with it for the entire session.
Additionally, I go in for PT twice a week. The staff is very friendly, understanding, and welcoming. They cater to people of all ages and different activity levels and injuries. Odane has been excellent in providing a variety of extensive strengthening and mobility exercises to help stabilize the injured area. He is extremely attentive and corrects your form to ensure you achieve the best results. They will also provide ice or heat after sessions, depending on what each individual needs.
If all other CORA facilities are run in this manner, I would highly recommend seeking them out if you ever are in need of physical therapy.

Unfortunately, the way appointments are managed left me really disappointed. Each therapist is assigned so many patients at once that you barely get five minutes of direct attention during your session.

I even asked if there was a less busy time to schedule, but the best I was told was that around noon the therapist might “only” have three patients at the same time. That didn’t feel like real, focused care to me.

In the end, I canceled my future appointments because it seemed less about actual healing and more about rushing people through for the business side of things.

I changed insurance due to change in employment, they relayed to me that I needed a new evaluation. When I asked why they replied with ""it's our policy"". Now, this obviously doesn't make sense as they did the initial evaluation, it's the same injury, the same prescription, just the insurance change.

I had already done my research and knew that a new evaluation is not needed whatsoever as far as insurance companies go. The only beneficiary to this would be CORA as they would happily take an extra payment from myself or the insurance.

The employee I spoke with said that this was the direction from the manager. I don't like to use the word ""SCAM"" or ""FRAUD"", but I really hope this was just an error in judgement from someone that didn't think things through and not an actual corporate mandate.

Patients come to this facility seeking respect, compassion, and support — unfortunately, that is not what I experienced with her.

To be clear, the physical therapists at this location are absolutely caring, professional, and supportive. However, I cannot say the same for this particular front desk staff member.

During my first encounter, I had trouble checking in and showed her my phone for assistance. Instead of helping, she responded with a rude tone, saying that if I couldn’t check in, I couldn’t be seen. When I asked if someone could assist me, she dismissively told me to sit down. A few minutes later, a physical therapist kindly helped me and provided excellent care.

My second encounter was over the phone. She scheduled me for a 1:00 PM appointment but never asked about the treatment area and then quickly hung up before I could ask another question. When I called back to clarify, she repeatedly cut me off. When I asked her to please calm down, she told me to calm down instead.

This type of unprofessional and disrespectful behavior should not happen in a healthcare setting. Patients deserve kindness, patience, and professionalism from the moment they walk in the door.

Then my last surgery, Kelly did my initial evaluation with the same professionalism.
she then handed me off to Sammy, who also was very professional, competent, and empathetic, as well as encouraging when I felt episodes of pretty severe pain to my arm.
And last but not least Ms Sully at the front desk, who also was very professional, competent, and helped  me facilitate renewing additional sessions with my insurance and surgeon.

As a APRN, with years of hospital/ICU/PACU experience I will say I can vouch for the importance of PT/OT/ST in facilitating improved care and outcomes, I now recommend and give referrals for PT or OT to a few of my patients because of my experience at CORA North Tampa.

Jenny at the front desk is so kind, professional and really works to help schedule my therapy when it works best for me.  Though I’m continuing my journey, the therapist Dusty, Jeannette and Adam have helped me every step of the way.

Dusty has greatly impacted my life.  I don’t think I knew how far I had to go until U met with him.  He devises a therapy plan that’s very specific to me.  He’s a brilliant doctor who listens to needs.  He is teaching me life skills that I will take with me forever.  I’ve learned so much from him.  He never hesitates to explain exactly how an activity will help improve my health.  He takes his compassion and empowers me to be motivated every session.  He cares about me as a whole person which has built my confidence to not be as fearful when facing new challenges.  I know he cares.  He communicates with me and my doctors as we are a team.  I could never thank him enough.  He is going to be leaving this CORA as he travels to different places around the country to practice his physical therapy skills.  I’m already missing him as he has a way of giving me a new tool to help me improve.  I didn’t know how to ask for what I needed but he seemed to listen and use his great expertise to give me the exact tools needed.  Thank you Dusty for my toolbox and your willingness to so graciously share your skills and talent with me.

I have worked with Jeannette several times as well.  Her energy, passion and compassion can be seen and felt the moment you meet her.  What’s amazing about CORA in Ormond Beach, Florida is each therapist has different sets of trainings and specific expertise.  She used a metal tool that relieved the pain in my knee.  She messaged or rubbed the metal tool and the pain eased up…I felt like I could finally take a breath.  She has been with me through the tears and challenges….she is a true angel in my life.

Adam runs the center and I must say he’s terrific.  To create a place of healing with caring professionals,  wow!

They have all changed my life for the better!

About three and a half months after therapy had begun I saw my ortho and he was concerned that I wasn't coming along. (I'm 69 and the shoulder had begun to fray nearly 15 years ago.) I told CORA that I thought they were not engaged enough in my recovery, and they suddenly discharged me.

I have been to 8-10 different PT facilities in my life and this facility is anything but class leading.   It suffices to provide bare minimum, but that is it.  Location is small and not well updated.  Carpet is old, ceiling panels are stained, lights in the ceilings are not working.  So you walk in and it is just not a brightly lit place that gives off a positive vibe.  You end up sharing your PT assistant with at least one other client.  Today there were two PT assistance working with FIVE clients.  How is the PT assistant going to watch your form and effort and give you positive reinforcement when they are off on someone else?

This poor review shouldn't reflect on the people working there.  The people are great.   They care.  They know their craft.

This has been the best PT I have ever received BY FAR . If you don’t read past this, know this: I have had a Meniscus surgery - and a year later a total knee replacement and a total hip replacement - within seven months of each other.  The latter surgery having been Feb 24th, 2025. My world has relied heavily on PT and I wish everyone had access to this level of care and attention to detail. It is evident that this location is wonderfully managed from the morale and tone that is set. The therapists are great. It is clean.  They run on time but don’t rush people.  The list of pros goes on and on…..

I did a lot of research on Physical therapy offices and read a lot of reviews in preparation before having the total knee replacement in August of 2024. I had a meniscus surgery a year prior and was not impressed with the PT at Jewett Hospital. I made the decision to go to the Cora in Rockledge, FL - and they were awesome! I was really happy with that decision. I had great results which really impressed my Clinical team at Jewett. Then, I found out that I needed the total hip replacement. Since I was going to be in Lakeland following my surgery and during recovery, I found this Cora location and booked. I feel so blessed and so grateful I did. I have been having a complicated case and Keyshla and Cheryl, my 2 therapists, have been so incredible on so many levels. They are warm, caring and delightful, and what’s more,  is that the way they practice is so helpful because they are thorough, informative and attentive. They explain things and reasons as to why and what the exercise is going to do in addition on how to - and they pay attention and correct form, which is major! They really take their time and you can feel how much they care about and watch out for their patients. They and the clinic operate at a high standard of excellence that I wish all therapists and offices would do.   I feel bad for people who don’t know what this level of care looks like or that it even exists. Everyone there is great!

A special thank you to Sean for truly listening and understanding the type of physical therapy I needed to address the pain in my left side, including my back, foot, and knee. Each session I was able to feel the difference. I still need to work on my back an foot but at least now I know how to work on it properly. Mucho Gracias Cindy for making sure each session I hit my target. The extra sessions definitely helped.

I highly recommend this therapy center to anyone in need of physical therapy.
Everyone is great an the vibe is also good they all work very well together. They are all very kind an very understanding an make you feel very comfortable 😌

Patients who are being ""treated"" face those who are waiting for their turn. And the wait could become longer if the therapist is having a business meeting in some private room.
Actually, the rules vary all the time: lunch time differs in accordance with the day and the team. So, if u need anything from the staff, u must wait until they have resurfaced after their unspecified lunch break.
And the day is usually one hour shorter in the morning and one hour shorter in the evening for telephone users.
The funniest thing about this place is that rules are not equally respected. So, at the time when one therapist can train 2 or 3 patients simultaneously, punctuality must be religiously observed by the patients although the length of the session is decided by the therapist on the spur of the moment.
But the worst feature I happened to encounter in this place was lack of cleanliness. Those tools and machines were never wiped in my presence. Some of them had the tag ""Clean"" stuck to the wall next to them, but the tag was never moved or removed. Actually, the walls had papers, memos and greeting cards that looked at least one or two years old. And I always asked myself whether this place had ever received a clean-up job, especially every time I touched the slippery handles of this or that machine.
My plan was to leave this facility for ever at the end of my course, but a silly clash with the vindictive reception manager who was ready to sacrifice the whole world in return for some extra minutes of her long weekend made me change my mind and warn others against getting involved in this business.",2024-09-03 01:24:23,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXj4zvbXJGphMhT3IykOCT2La7_WnKKYn8GKoyedMC4N_0Nmt31=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:02:42.846041,,

I felt a difference for sure; my muscles got stronger. The therapists and the staff there were very knowledgeable, super nice, friendly, and approachable.

My mom had physical therapy a few years ago at the same location, but her experience was totally different than mine.

In August they told me that my insurance company didn't pay them on time in July (but they paid timely every other month). This is when the hinky billing started. They charged me for 3 visits in one week. I paused my kids treatment for a month after confirming I did not owe them anymore money. I called to resume treatment and was told I had a past due balance.  Remember, they have my credit card on file. When I called to speak with the manager, she charged my card. So had I not called to resume treatment, she would have never charged my card. She claims the new charges are from August. I reminded her I spoke with her on 8/29 and she said I was all paid up.

Cadenza Center for Psychotherapy & the Arts,(954) 925-3191,ChIJgaprrMKr2YgRyAK1_gY8cIc,Lady Jo,1,"BLACK WOMEN BEWARE!
As a Black woman seeking mental health care, my experience at this office has been deeply troubling, frustrating, and discriminatory. From the outset, I encountered obstacles and unprofessional behavior that left me feeling dismissed and unheard, largely due to selective policy enforcement and racial bias.
When I initially tried to schedule my appointment, I was told by a staff member that I could not make the appointment without a card on file, despite the fact that my insurance covers the full cost of the treatment. This staff member’s refusal to make an exception prompted me to request speaking to the office manager. The office manager, after calling me back the following day, made a one-time courtesy and allowed me to schedule the appointment with the understanding that once I received my card, I would update the office. I ordered a card specifically for this purpose because the office required a card to be on file. I was told the card would take five to seven business days to arrive, and once I received it, I promptly updated their system on December 19th.
From the outset, their staff enforced policies against me unfairly, claiming that my activated and valid card was declined, which resulted in the cancellation of my critical mental health evaluation. This evaluation was a necessary step in managing my treatment and medications. Despite having provided my card on December 19, they claimed it wasn’t activated and canceled my appointment for December 26.
On January 6, 2025, I called the office with the intention of resolving this matter and speaking to the office manager. I calmly explained what had transpired, my frustration over the appointment being canceled, and the way I was dismissed. At that point, the office manager dismissively stated that the card “probably wasn’t activated”—a statement that belittled me and implied that I was too incompetent to properly handle something as simple as activating a credit card. This comment made it clear that she was gaslighting me and deflecting responsibility for the error on her end. As I gave her the same card details for the second time, she confirmed that the card was accepted.
I had provided the same card details December 19th, so why was it only now being accepted? The only difference was that I had confronted the office manager regarding their mishandling of my appointment. I strongly feel that the staff member initially declined my card and canceled my appointment because I had requested to speak to the office manager, which shows the office’s blatant discriminatory behavior. The office made the decision to apply the policies selectively—refusing to accept my card and blaming me for their error just. It was clear their decision wasn’t based on any real issue with my card but instead reflected discriminatory practices. This experience reinforces harmful stereotypes often directed at Black individuals, particularly around financial irresponsibility, which is deeply hurtful and discriminatory.
When I rightfully expressed frustration about how this mishandling delayed my care, the office manager dismissed me, she flatly refused to acknowledge the inconsistency, weaponized harmful stereotypes about Black women being angry or unprofessional and ultimately dismissed me, refusing my service altogether.
She ultimately denied me further care because I refused to overlook her gaslighting. My frustration escalated, but I still asked to speak with a supervisor or the doctor, and I was told to send an email to their office. I sent a detailed email explaining my experience, laying out my concerns about the mistreatment, the clear inconsistency in how policies were applied, and the unprofessional behavior I’d encountered.
Rather than acknowledging or addressing the situation, the doctor herself perpetuated this bias by siding with her staff without ever reaching out to me for my side of the story or investigating the matter further.",2025-01-07 10:36:07,9 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKTIMaK_ZeXo1Rctq-kRsx2ngFeaocokZFrj9KUySdPml5ZSg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:02:50.403363,,

We named our little guy Dock—I know, not the most original name considering our love for the water—but his middle name is Strawberry, so that helps add a little flair!

He’s been doing so well. I had planned to bring in a trainer, but he’s been such a quick learner that I’ve taken on the training myself. He already waits patiently at the door before going out, waits for permission before eating, and hasn’t had a single accident in the house—well, except for one that we can’t really blame him for. My husband has a golf putting green in his office that looks a lot like grass… so Dock just did what he thought he was supposed to do!

We gave him his first haircut recently. Since it's been so hot, we opted for a more practical summer cut instead of the traditional Portuguese Water Dog style—but don’t worry, he’ll be rocking the classic look come winter.

He’s already been out on the boat a few times and absolutely loves the water. He fits into our family so naturally—it feels like he’s always been with us.

Thank you for being such a thoughtful and responsible breeder. It’s clear how much care you put into your work, and it made the whole process so smooth for us. More breeders should follow your example!

When I first arrived in Orlando 5 months ago, I had no intention of staying beyond a few months. However, after discovering Camen, my plans quickly changed—I’ve since chosen to sign a lease and remain in the area.

As someone who holds high standards for ethical and professional practice, I am often cautious when evaluating organizations. That said, Camen has exceeded my expectations. The administrative team is responsive, communicative, and efficient when it comes to scheduling and managing changes. The management team fosters a warm, welcoming environment and maintains a genuine open-door policy.

What stands out most is the compassion shown to employees, particularly those managing their own diagnoses. As long as there is openness to feedback and a willingness to grow, Camen provides a supportive space to become a quality therapist.

Not always but the edge is clearly there for all to experience. I love the staff there and my dog has loved going to CM three days a week for 2 years.   My investments over the past two years are in the thousands of dollars.  On holidays I brought food for the crew.
So I was amazed at how non-caring their manager was when I adopted a new dog and asked for an opportunity to bring him into the Camp family.  First, no response, except to tell me I needed vet clearances, which I quickly obtained.  Six weeks rolls by and I have now asked multiple times for a dog trial visit.  So I called and reluctantly pulled my existing dog out of their program.  The person I spoke with could only cite staff rules.  Oh my what a disappointment.

Camp Run-A-Mutt Gainesville,(352) 226-8282,ChIJ-9QDQYSj6IgRxPvmVwazGxE,Madisen Griffis,1,"Edit 2/2: Since the timing of my review seems to be a concern, I’ll clarify. After Maeve’s stay, I decided that communal boarding was not the right fit for us. A recent trip left me scrambling to find boarding and reminded me of our experience (and how I wish I felt comfortable with facilities like this). After reviewing the photos and videos from 2023, I decided to share our experience.
While I appreciate the business responding, their focus appears to be more on the timing of my review than on the substance of the concerns. Even if I had reached out at the time, it would not have changed our experience nor would I have been comfortable with any explanation, as it seems we have different views on what’s acceptable. My intent here is to share information transparently so that others can make informed decisions for their pets.

Edit 1/2: I’ve added a photo showing the date they were taken in response to the owner. I also figured out how to add videos so I’ve added those as well. And again, there’s no reason for one dog to be restrained in an area with 20+ off leash dogs. Several of them were herding her around the yard, which isn’t an inherently negative behavior, but the point is how this can make the restrained dog feel vulnerable and potentially display fear-based behaviors.

My dog, Maeve, stayed at Camp-Run-A-Mutt in 2023. I hate leaving bad reviews so I chose not to but recently came across the video I took of her when we got back home after her stay (of which I’ve attached screenshots). There are a lot of positive reviews for this business, and it makes me wonder if anyone else has had a bad experience and also chose not to say anything. I’m not looking for any response from the business, I just want to put the situation out there for people to consider when booking a stay for their dogs.

I saw a sore under her chin the day she got home from her stay. It looked so bad in person that I initially thought maybe another dog had bitten her. But I remembered there were a couple of times I checked the cameras and saw her itching under her chin and just didn’t think much about it at the time. She must have been allergic to something on site, but that’s not the issue. She was supposed to get a bath on her on her last day (which I paid extra for), and I’d assume someone would’ve seen it and notified me if she was bathed (or bathed properly). So the thought that she was neglected enough for no one to take note of her constantly itching enough to cause a wound like that, for the sore to not be noticed at all, and them taking my money and not bathing her (or she was bathed and someone saw the sore and chose to not tell me - I’m not sure which is worse) put such a bad taste in my mouth.

I also have a video recording of one of the live streams where Maeve is the only dog on a leash out of ~30 dogs. The worker was walking her around the yard and visibly tugging on the leash to make her walk. If you know anything about dog behavior, one dog being restrained and the rest being free causes anxiety in the restrained dog. They was tugging on her when she was visibly cowering because she was anxious. I have no idea why she was leashed but I can say for an absolute fact that she doesn’t have a mean bone in her body to have caused an issue to warrant that. I have a problematic dog, bless his heart, and she is not that. And even if something did happen, remove her from the area and call me. In the video, the worker eventually takes the leash off of her, she walks over to the fence line and gets pushed against the fence and bullied by another dog RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WORKER and they didn’t react at all. I included a series of screenshots of this since Google isn’t allowing me to add a video.

This review is not a dig at the owners of the facility, because I imagine it’s difficult to manage a business like this and stay on top of everything. But due to our experience with the staff at the time, it wasn’t worth returning or even making a huff about it with them because it wasn’t going to change Maeve’s experience.",2025-04-27 04:31:44,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLskuX4WAZwRNyXealh1waWK8ZC2LZvAJ9saH7ifo5i9S2aaw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:02:52.722109,,

She really is a dog whisperer. And Chloe is on her way to become a service dog.

Our goal was to train her as a service dog for a family member. We immediately started training at PetSmart to socialize her. She did well and even though she progressed through 4 private training classes and passed the intermediate class at PetSmart she did not know how to sit (part of her abuse was that she was kicked.) We scheduled a boot camp with Anna and she went to her home for 3 days. Chloe learned to sit and we are so proud of her! We continued at PetSmart through the Advanced class and then scheduled another boot camp with Anna to address distractions, barking and to learn her service (interrupted behaviors.)  Chloe made so much progress. She is doing much better with distractions and has truly learned interrupted behaviors as her service. It is actually amazing how she learned this so quickly. Chloe is starting to make progress with barking and Anna taught us lots of ways to continue to address this with patience. Anna has been available daily for our questions since Chloe finished boot camp and has provided lots of reinforcement. We absolutely plan to do one more boot camp in a few months for correction, maintenance and reinforcement of service dog behaviors.

We asked Ana to come and meet our Basenji and see weather or not they get along. Our Luna loved Ana. So we agreed to a 4 part training session.  For $550.00. Our first session was at a pet store . We met there so that Luna could meet other dogs and start socializing her. But what I really was hoping is That Luna could be trained so that we could go to public places with her.the next session was at the same place and again Ana brought her dog with her telling us that her dog would be there to make it easier for Luna to except other dogs. Luna would growl when dogs came near her. Well we went to the park with Luna and wanted to see Luna's reaction through the fence. . It wasn't good. We called Ana and asked her to meet at the park the next time but made excuses not to. We needed to go away for a couple of days so we made arrangements with Ana to watch LUNA. WE WANTED TO SEE WHERE SHE WOULD BE STAYING AND SO WE SAID OK BEACH HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD.  We'll it turn out that is not where she stayed. Ana wasn't honest with us. Will picked her up at Ana,s home but couldn't let us in because she said her dog was very sick and had diarrhea all over the house. We don't believe that. Any way we still wanted to give Ana a chance we contacted her and told her that we were very upset with all of this. And wanted her to work with Luna and her walking. She agreed.  In a couple of weeks she said. When we called back she was sick. We then asked for the money back for the 2 remaining lessons. We haven't heard back from Ana.

Canine Counselors,(305) 264-0027,ChIJu7OMVIi42YgRpvefZVW5T9s,Alexandra Paz,5,"Canine Counselors came highly recommended to me by my boss — and wow, what a game changer. Working with Danielle has truly changed our lives and set our golden retriever puppy, Ford, up for lifelong success. We started the program when Ford was about 3.5 months old, and I can confidently say it was the perfect time to begin.

From the very first phone call, I felt a huge sense of relief. I reached out feeling overwhelmed, like we were doing something wrong, and Danielle instantly helped us realize that everything we were experiencing was totally normal for a young puppy. Her reassurance, expertise, and calm, kind approach gave us the tools we needed — not just to train Ford, but to feel confident and capable as new dog parents.

Danielle is incredibly knowledgeable and truly passionate about what she does. She took the time to explain the “why” behind every method, always tailoring the training to fit Ford’s unique personality. Her support went far beyond the basic obedience work — she instilled in us the skills to keep growing and reinforcing good habits at home.

One of the best parts of the program is the lifetime access to group lessons and annual check-ins, which we plan to take full advantage of. It gives us peace of mind knowing that we’ll always have continued guidance as Ford grows.

Thanks to Danielle, Ford is quickly becoming the best boy in the world — and we feel empowered and equipped to keep him on that path. We are endlessly grateful and can’t recommend Danielle and Canine Counselors enough!",2025-09-02 20:30:09,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWsYu8Ig_r5JG0KqS6_QorhDD_s70tYM8YA3I8AaseNdyQqBiky=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:02:58.011948,,

She took the time to explain the “why” behind every technique, which really helped us feel confident in raising a well-behaved dog.

She guided us through the tricky puppy phase with practical tools and consistent support. One of the things we appreciated most was how available she was to answer our questions, even outside of scheduled sessions.

We came in struggling with on-leash reactivity, and by the end of the program, I had a much more confident and obedient dog.

What stood out the most was their honesty and communication throughout the entire process. They kept me updated regularly with realistic, no-fluff feedback—even when my dog was having a tough time. It meant a lot to have trainers who didn’t sugarcoat things but instead helped me understand what was really going on and how to move forward.

They also made sure I, as the owner, was fully equipped to maintain the progress my dog made. They explained everything I needed to do clearly and gave me the tools and support for post-training success. The follow-up care and guidance have made all the difference.

The results were amazing—my dog has transformed into a well-mannered and obedient companion, an amazing service animal, their work has been meticulous, our Tokyo graduated by traveling on an airplane ride with the trainers.  Their positive reinforcement techniques made the training sessions enjoyable and effective. Not only did my dog learn essential commands, but I also gained the confidence and skills to reinforce good behavior at home. Best of all is the ongoing support we receive from them.

They completely transformed my dog for the better, and provided me with proper the tools and training to succeed when I am out in the real world no matter what the situation. I had a rehab situation with my 1 year old Shiba Inu, if you know anything about this breed you know that they are VERY stubborn and can sometimes be aggressive. We were having some severe resource guarding and aggressions issues towards myself and other dogs. I had even gotten bit a few times drawing blood. I was almost losing hope and then I was referred to Dorian from Canine Tech.

I gave him a call and from the jump he was asking me all the right questions and knew exactly what I was going through. A few days later I dropped my dog Nobu off for the 30 day obedience fundamental course. I will admit it was hard at first to think about being away from my dog for that long but Dorian took the time to physically see what was going on he assured me he would be in good hands and walked me through the facility. Throughout the course of the 30 days Dorian and his team checked in with me and sent picture and videos updates of the progress Nobu was making.

After the 30 days were up my wife and I came in for our first one on one training session with Nobu and I could not believe the dog before my eyes! Nobu was so obedient and happy to see us. During the multiple training sessions they taught us the proper commands and guided us with the right tools for working with our dog. Dorian even threw in an extra lesson at no charge because he wanted to be 100% certain that we were confident we were good to go and we were confident in ourselves.

Nobu is back home with us and happier than ever, I can't thank Dorian and his team enough.

They are very safety conscious: they have at least one person walking next to the horses on the ground all the time for beginner rides. The horses are well cared for, I love the small setting and everyone was friendly and knowledgeable, and the trails are beautiful.

I called a few weeks ago to make an appointment for my little guy for annual shots and his pro heart injection.  When I made the appointment I was quoted $185 for annual shots and exam and when I asked about the pro heart injection, I was put on hold so they could check because its done by weight.  The nice girl came back and said it would be about $40 and I wrote that down.  We go today and they tell me the pro heart injection is $200!!!  For a 12 pound guy??????  Last September my 83 pound dog's pro heart injection was $157.  How does this make sense?  They said it's now a flat fee and it doesn't matter what weight the dog is????  Really, isn't heart worm preventative always done by weight?  I am disappointed in them as this seems like an extreme increase.  I was upset enough to cancel all future appointments and ask them to forward me all health records.

Bring your dog here! Dr. Lomnicki saved our dogs life and our vacation all in one! We were getting ready for an international flight, our dog had some “juice” come out of his butt, I was worried it was an anal gland infection and we were blessed to get in. Turned out it wasn’t anything to worry about and we went home. My kiddos were eating grapes, and our youngest fed our dog grapes before we realized it! Grapes can kill your dog and we were 3 hours out from being on a plane! I called the vet in a panic and they had us come back immediately. No hesitation, they knew this was serious! Dr. Lomnicki, kept my husband calm as she took our dog to the back to make him vomit. He vomited the grapes whole and the doctor came in and explained that since they were whole and not chewed he would be ok. We can not express our gratitude enough! It was obvious her care and concern was all around our dog and that just meant the world to us. Cape Coral Pet Vet reacted to our situation and saved the day! We are loyal to them through and through, again and again they show us they are in it for the animals! We can not express enough how wonderful this facility is!

I had to go home and Google his diagnosis and figure it all out for myself. 3wks later we switched to another Dr only to find out that her plan wasn't going to work because the disease was already too progressed. But at least Dr Sorrento tried to do something. He was kind and thoughtful even though he was very honest.
My beautiful 5yr old dog is dead now and I can't help but think maybe had she actually examined him at his appointment, maybe had she bothered to speak to me over a year ago when it was identified.

Care Animal Clinic,(863) 665-2000,ChIJySe5muM-3YgRMZLkcbCYBjg,Robert Fortner,5,"I’ve trusted Dr. Carrier at Care Animal Clinic with my cat Taz’s care for years, and he has always been professional, compassionate, and genuinely dedicated to his patients.

Recently on Tuesday night when Taz suddenly became very ill and was showing signs of dying, I rushed him to Vets ER off Socrum Loop. I explained clearly to the ER vet that I was under financial strain and needed honest guidance about his condition. Despite that, they barely examined him, missed obvious signs of jaundice and liver failure, gave him fluids and a stomach injection, and sent us home—charging me a significant amount in the process. Taz continued to suffer for 24 more hours, which could have and should have been avoided had they taken his condition seriously. Given how advanced his symptoms were, euthanasia should have been compassionately recommended then.

On Wednesday morning- the next available appointment I could get him in, I brought Taz back to Dr. Carrier. Without needing additional testing, he immediately recognized that Taz was jaundiced and in liver failure. He handled the situation with grace and empathy, helping me make the heartbreaking but humane decision to end Taz’s suffering. I’m so grateful for the care he showed not only to Taz, but to me as well in such a difficult moment.

If you’re looking for a veterinarian who truly puts your pet’s well-being—and your situation—first, I can’t recommend Dr. Carrier highly enough. His compassion and honesty stand in stark contrast to what I experienced elsewhere.",2025-07-31 16:08:09,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFOXiYKnFTOHGXSswLZQPIWjHfmZMMIJZXXxT5SXdlIzc02l8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:03:05.604105,,

Then a week ago, our older dog was dying, and we talked to Jessica at the office asking for price for 2 shots to put our dog down, we were told $289!! My husband questioned that amount, and asked if we could get a discount because of our other two dogs being patients there, and that we’ve spent hundreds of dollars there, she became a rude, non compassionate smart alleck !

Despite how pleasant the people and atmosphere are, there is a flaw. It's a bit disorganized.

I had to fill out documentation several times over because the system was a bit wonky. I didn't really mind, but it did tack on another 20 minutes to the time I spent there. Also, I went in under the impression I'd be paying around $440 for both cats to get seen (this is the quote they initially gave me). They then informed me that this price was for one cat and that the total would be somewhere around $900. THEN I was informed that the information was put into the system wrong and that I would need to pay $1200. I think this is a reasonable price for everything that was getting done, but I really do wish someone could've told me from the beginning...

edit to respond to reply:

i was never told it was an emergency, my concerns were shrugged off in the first visit. therefore if i am given an expensive list of different and unnecessary things i will decline some for financial reasons. i was told i could personally choose between treatment options, dr never recommended a specific route, and i am not an expert. by the last appointment, he was was in respiratory distress, and clearly much worse condition than his first visit, and i was just sent home with an appointment scheduled for the following WEEK (as if he would make it that long) instead of to an emergency vet. he died that same night.",2025-09-04 15:52:47,a month ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUZcxN4tZ8h4aS1MKygUF_ScjkDyhq1-jMM6PtIQGaHPb3uMTc1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:03:09.855728,,

They have riders who are just sitting on horses for the first time, and riders showing consistently in the A circuit; they welcome any level and will move at each individual’s speed. They have completely transformed my riding and have spurred my confidence immeasurably, but most importantly, take care of my horses as if they are their own. They have 100% of my trust when it comes to proper horse management. If you want a barn filled with highly knowledgeable professionals that prioritize the health and safety of their horses and riders, Carriage Hill Farms is the perfect place to be.

Although I was initially apprehenisive about board-and-train programs, this was the best money we have ever spent. Lucy was on her way to becoming an unruly and destructive adolescent dog when Jimmy and Dania stepped in to save us. The team at Casper's loved our dog and helped her build her self-awareness and impulse control. Lucy came back to us a different dog (still the same goofy and boistrous spirit) but now with obedience and self control. She was returned happy, clean and in great condition. Lucy is now so much happier knowing what is expected of her. Having a calm well-mannered dog is such a gift to our family. We could not have trained this difficult breed on our own. Jimmy and Dania spent many hours working with us and our kids to get to know Lucy's commands and handling. I recently dropped Lucy back off at Casper's for a weekend boarding and she was so excited to see her old friends. It was clear she had good memories of her experience. We hope to keep working with Jimmy and his team for more advanced training as Lucy gets older.

When I first brought my dog here, we were struggling with serious aggression issues—walks were stressful, visits from friends were impossible, and I worried constantly about his safety and ours.

From day one, the trainers were patient, knowledgeable, and completely dedicated to helping us succeed. They didn’t just “train” my dog—they took the time to understand his triggers, his body language, and the root cause of his behavior. Every step of the program was tailored to his needs, and I received clear guidance on how to continue the training at home.

The results have been incredible. My dog is calmer, more confident, and able to be around other people and dogs without the constant stress we once had. I’ve also learned so much about how to be a better, more confident leader for him.

If your dog struggles with aggression, do not hesitate—this camp is compassionate, professional, and truly life-changing.

We were out of options for my aggressive, anxious, insecure dog and Jimmy and his team allowed him to have a normal life that he feels comfortable and confident in. My dog had SEVERE separation/storm anxiety and aggression towards other animals. I’m talking he’s jumped out of a second story window, ripped out his own teeth/nails, and broken through countless crates and doors. He has been on multiple strong prescription medications and still no change. I felt like there was nothing that could help him. After completing the board and train program, he is a completely different dog (in the best ways). He has not had another incident of aggression nor harming himself due to anxiety.

Her approach is to evaluate not only the area having the problem but your whole body. This approach allows her to find root causes of your pain.

She is literally very “hands on” - this allows her to make adjustments that facilitate healing. She follows every session with detailed emails with videos showing exactly what needs to be done to fully resolve your issues.

I have seen Cathy for shoulder, neck, foot and most recently hip issues. I am never disappointed and she always helps resolve my issue. A further plus is her extensive knowledge of the body and enthusiastic attitude.

I strongly recommend seeing Cathy for any issues you may have.",2025-03-26 06:23:04,6 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIDIBwR2vt_t-id5giFSOlwCt0gdto5V3Md9-1cbEvOkI-HZg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:03:20.253858,,

The owner is publicly known as a pretty terrible person and has very unprofessional billing procedures and has kicked clients out for being unable to pay thousands at a time, and kicked my 3 year old out because I stood up to her. I loved my therapist, but would never advise anyone to take their child there because of billing and mistreatment being so prevalent there. Work closely with you insurance when going here. My insurance called me and said they think there was fraud going on, at best neglect with timely claims procedures, which led to multiple problems. We also had therapists who were not experienced or certified to lead my child's therapy program working with him-another major insurance issue. My 3 year old has regressed since we have gone over a month without services since we were kicked out with NO NOTICE over the owner's personal issues with me (I mentioned my experience with my support group, and someone told her about it and she lost her cool in fear of more bad PR), note I am not her client (my 3 year old with severe nonverbal autism is) but I am his mother who paid this company thousands in co-pays, and the insurance paid her around 150,000 per year. Pretty awful to do to a kid no matter how you look at it. It's about the children. We are glad we are gone from Cayer Behavioral, but we are deeply saddened to see our little boy regress so much and lose valuable time in therapy. We will be much happier when we begin with Engage.

Center For Autism & Related,(904) 633-0760,ChIJHztyY3TJ5YgRwEWcP5IkDjE,xero one,1,"Since my son was 2 going on 3 I heard so much great things about this place but still went through different venues for care because I was not convinced that my son was autistic at that time.  When my son was 8 I finally decided to try CARD and after a year of gathering everything they asked me for I was told I was going to be placed on the waiting list.  FIVE YEARS LATER I finally got a call and had a psychiatric evaluation for my son.

I cannot aptly describe my shock at how terribly things went and my extreme disappointment at the deliberate strategy of the psychiatrist to use his training to gaslight me, belittle me, disrespect me, berate me, and create a distressing and frustrating environment during the entire evaluation.  This same strategy was applied to my son to undermine his accomplishments and underrate his achievements to disprove his aptitude and further gaslight me regarding his achievements. Everything my son did correctly he said it was incorrect.  He asked my son to show him something and my son pointed to it, then he said my son is incorrect and actually asked me later when did my son regress and stop pointing.

My son's teacher said he is the best student in her class and this man was acting like he was totally academically incapable.  Furthermore his attack on my education, parenting, intelligence and worth as a person lets me know that this organization is not ready to work with parents of Autistic children.

Parents, please do not let these professionals discourage you.  You are highly skilled, socially capable, brilliant, loving, strong, knowledgeable, respectable, courageous, resilient and magnificent.  Keep pushing forward for your child and don't ever doubt your certainty of their skills and aptitude.  It is not an easy road and you deserve a team that will honor your hard work by working with you and your child instead of against.

They called us to repair a roof leak that was causing havoc in their medical area. We did a great job at a great price and stopped the leak on the first visit. The roof is in really bad shape and it was very difficult to fix.

Now they tell us that they don't have enough money to pay the contract amount. They say they can't pay a lot of their bills and that they are very sorry

If they can't pay their bills what kind of medical service can they provide that is safe. I'm telling you. I would not go their to have my toenails trimmed.

CenterWell Home Health,(321) 725-4799,ChIJIedQhBEO3ogRKTuELwwCWK8,Cindi Wellman,5,"I cannot speak highly enough about Centerwell Home Care. I have used this company twice and found staff  to be prompt, knowledgeable, and very kind. Being a nurse myself for almost 30 years gave me a good baseline by which to evaluate this group. Renee was the nurse admitting me….she explained things in an expert manner and took her time to get to know me a little bit. I truly enjoyed talking with her about the changes in healthcare over the years. She listened to me when I said I had reactions to adhesives and did her best to prevent blisters under my PICC line dressing.  Michaela was my primary nurse. Both she and Renee worked around my many doctor appointments to schedule their visits and that was very much appreciated. All staff showed a great deal of empathy towards my situation. (Caregiver becoming the patient) which, while not unique, was quite hard on me. No one complained about where they work either. One would think no one would disparage their own organization when talking to a patient but I have had it happen a number of times with other companies. During my last hospitalization, Centerwell told the case manager they could not admit me to service until Monday ; however, I was determined to discharge Friday. When I had an issue over the weekend, I called center well and they did their best to problem solve  with me even though I was not yet their patient. I cannot recommend them any more highly!",2024-10-25 08:47:19,11 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ5kfA0AAmDBwBZXyjbSmK5sOmmKtDT7GXdtpCQvxvP-UPgRw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:03:27.292842,,

I’ve worked with therapists in the past, but I never stuck with any of them  until Job. He’s different. He really puts himself in your shoes and helps you see yourself clearly. He’s empathetic, straight to the point, and genuinely caring.

He doesn’t just talk he gives you tools. Whether it’s book recommendations or actionable steps, he’s always helping move the process forward.

I honestly give him 10 stars across the board. I pray that God blesses his business double for how much he’s helped me and others.

From start to finish, Sally & her team made everything so easy and stress-free.

"Cheyne Ranch, Inc.",(407) 205-7744,ChIJP4FeI8hB54gRnuR6jbNElWg,Jessica Mahon,5,"Cheyne Ranch is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible and unique organizations I’ve had the pleasure of being involved with. While there seems to be no shortage of riding facilities popping up here in Central Florida, I’d like to highlight all of the ways that Sally, her family and her team are unique and desperately needed within our community. Warning, this is going to be long but it’s worth sharing.

First and foremost, Sally has truly created a safe haven and safe space for kids (and adults) of all different abilities and neurodiversities. When we first started going here, we were in the thick of it trying to find places where our neurodiverse son might be welcomed. Parents with neurodiverse or disabled kids know all-to-well how much time, energy and resources go into finding therapists, specialists and opportunities to help your kid(s) thrive. They also know how few places there are that genuinely work to understand your child as their own person with their own needs, feelings and preferences.

Cheyne Ranch was the FIRST facility my son ever went where, rather than getting a laundry list of complaints at pick-up or multiple calls throughout the day, I instead arrived at camp pickup to receive nothing but glowing remarks about how great, easy, sweet, loving and all around wonderful my kid is. Over 2 years later and I can still vividly remember how monumental that felt and still cry writing about it now.

Sally makes everyone feel welcomed, seen, heard, valued and respected and she gives these kids the opportunity to thrive. She also gives them a chance to do hard things and realize how capable they actually are. Since we started homeschooling last year, my son gets to start his Friday mornings off with horseback riding lessons and then goes straight into a Homeschool Nature Club where he gets to hang out with kids who are both just like him and kids who are nothing like him. Each and every one of them thrive there.

Many of the animals here are rescued and have personalities bigger than most people. The kids get to learn from the animals while also learning the importance of proper animal care. Sally sets clear, easy to follow, ground rules and her entire organization centers around the importance of trust and mutual respect. I’ve seen my son grow SO much from being here and can say without a shred of doubt, that I would continue homeschooling just for his time at Cheyne Ranch alone. Sally also works with local specialists like OTs and Speech Therapists to incorporate classes where the kids can receive therapies WITH the animals. Idk about you but I’d pick that over a classroom any day.

Last, but most importantly, Sally’s heart isn’t in making money out of any of this. She genuinely just wants to create a space where EVERYONE has a chance to learn about the animals, learn how to take care of them and to have a space where they feel safe and valued. This organization exists solely because there was a need within the community that hadn’t been filled and it’s grown to what it is because her heart was big enough to fill it. If you haven’t visited them yet, this is your sign to do so now.",2025-05-25 12:53:10,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV0la60KJ1Nh2c_43L2fGwwtycJK4Wq9__HR6vF7vhTWe218K3-=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:03:38.503417,,

After the appointment I was filled in on how it went and we had a follow up phone call to go over the report. Hannah also gave us recommendations for websites that will help us.

From the very first session 4 years ago in 2020, it was clear that they not only have a deep understanding of the challenges my child faces but also a genuine compassion and patience that has made a world of difference in his journey.

Our beloved child has struggled with both speech and occupational challenges, and it has been such a comfort to see how both Kathy and Miyuki tailor each session to his specific needs. Their approach is always warm, supportive, and encouraging, creating a safe space where my child feels comfortable to express himself and try new things, even when it's difficult. The patience they demonstrate is truly remarkable, always meeting him where he is and celebrating every small step forward with enthusiasm.

Since starting therapy, we have seen tremendous progress in his speech and his ability to navigate daily activities. He is more confident, able to communicate more clearly, and has shown improvement in his fine motor skills. It's been inspiring to witness his growth, and we know it’s all thanks to the dedication, skill, and empathy that Kathy and Miyuki bring to each session.

I appreciate this clinic so much for their dedication to provide quality service. I am happy to say that Eddie has developed functional speech ( Non Verbal at age 4 and 5 started developing much more at age 6 and 7). He can now express wants, needs and feelings.

Coastal Health Institute,(904) 300-2809,ChIJ0--mXge15YgRO_NRltzke_0,Melissa Bell,5,"I highly recommend Edsel Bittencourt as a physical therapist. Before I saw Edsel, I was still having major issues 7 months post total knee replacement. My knee was very swollen and hot to the touch. My range of motion was poor despite 6+ months of post operative PT and several months of chiropractic care. I walked with a very noticeable limp and was in constant pain. My orthopedic surgeon had even suggested a follow up surgery to try and figure out what was wrong.

Thankfully, within 1-2 appointments with Edsel, I was finally moving in the right direction. Swelling quickly dissipated and my knee was cool to the touch. I no longer walk with a limp, pain has significantly decreased, and I am continuing to make gains on my range of motion. He also corrected my hip misalignment during the initial session.

Edsel is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and compassionate. He spends a full hour per appointment performing manual therapy, Winback TECAR Therapy, and dry needling. Edsel truly understands how different body parts interconnect.

As a result he needs a lot of therapy. Allie was our OT therapist, there were a lot of harder days with Jaxson where he quite simply did not want to participate or would give a lot of push back. Allie was relentless and determined to find any solution she could. She leaned on her resources, offered to come watch him in his classroom and leaned into all of the things Jaxson enjoys. There was no other option but to be all in on team Jaxson. She got him to engage, even in some of our hardest sessions. We are focusing on getting our son sensory regulation therapy. He has a hard time with being able to regulate when his dad and I are not present. Once we see strides there we will be running right back into Allie’s care.

Professional and I needed replacement surgery on a knee,  hip and shoulder. 2 years ago I worked with them for a torn rotator cuff. I first saw the Orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clicic. He said if you are willing to do physical therapy for 4 months you may be able to avoid it. He mentioned he’s been sending his patients to Coleman and Baughman and has had good success with the results. I worked hard with them all winter and it worked!  Next I  was seeing if they could strengthen my knee to avoid knee replacement   That worked too!  Last up was a hip replacement that was done 2 years ago. I went through a Physical Therapy group in Minneapolis but that did not give me the rotation I needed for a full swing. So I spent this winter doing more PT on that hip. They are more than a cut above every other PT firm  I’ve ever worked with. It’s a boutique group that truly tailors a program for your specific issue. I’ve been to 3 other practices in the Jacksonville area and they are all cookie cutter. Everybody gets the same program for a specific body part. That does not work.

I found Come Sit Stay on Google based on the great reviews so I wanted to add one more for anyone on the fence. I rescued my dog Annie 4 years ago as a 10 month old and it had been on my list to find a trainer when I could afford the investment. Morgan’s programs work and are worth the investment! Annie went from barking at strangers and pulling hard on her leash to being excited to “come sit stay” which has made both her and me feel more relaxed during outings and when meeting new people and dogs. During my last training session, she serenely watched the birds on the beach which is a huge change from barking and pulling the leash wanting to chase them. We did the 5 lesson training with the e collar and it was a great experience. Highly recommend if you are looking for confidence in training and leading your rescue pup out in the world!

CommuniKids Miami Speech Therapy,(305) 343-8177,ChIJibmuw-my2YgRm2fdWWeO9zo,Anabelle Rivera,5,"Erica was a game changer for my son (who is diagnosed ASD) as well as me. I hired Erica referred by a friend for my son when he was around  4yrs old. He had already gone through several speech therapists since he was 3 but none used floortime (play time) and sensory input as she did at that time. I have heard and seen now more therapists integrating, but back then only a few or very difficult to find.

Initially she would film a couple of sessions with my son and me playing and then would review and share input  with me as well as demonstrate how to open, engage and close circles of conversations. She also was fantastic incorporating sensory elements that would enhance and provide stimulus for my son's engagement during sessions.

She helped me understand better how to follow leads from my son's communication and me building upon that and conversations, rather than me initiating. I also was able to  introduce new vocabulary naturally happening during play time.

At that time, I could not use words I can today and certainly I can say now she was coaching  me as well as Parent Training. At that time in life and still to date many therapists still fail with that part...Parent training and integration in sessions with their  children. THIS HELPS EMPOWER US  with tools and techniques to have a continuity with our children of what therapists do. Afterwards, I started integrating and asking all in everything I could with any service I hired.for my son. I believe to date that has been the biggest game changer in our journey.

As I look back at times with people who have made an impact/difference with us, Erica comes to mind.

He repeatedly left spots for questions and offered visual help as well as clarification.

He was my furry little child. I took him on a regular basis to Dr. Mattson and she always cared for him. With love and special attention along with the rest of her staff. When the day came that Peabo could no longer be with us, Dr. Mattson did everything she could to save him. Ultimately he didn't make it. Peabo lived for nearly 9 years which is much longer than most squirrels do. She had taken x-rays and put him on Oxygen and performed the normal exams. She also waived all of the fees incurred during his visit and care. She also offered to handle his cremation so that I did not have to endure that. I thanked her and told her that I would just take him home instead. I was completely distraught and bawling like a baby and she embraced me and even tied my shoes for me. I could not have asked for a better veterinarian and person to take care of him an our needs like she did. A week later I received a condolence card in the mail from her and her staff.

To start with the difficult part  during my stay, I was overmedicated while staff tried to determine what was wrong with me. The trial-and-error approach with medications left me feeling more confused and detached than helped at times. While I understand that diagnosis and treatment can be complex, I believe the process could have been handled with more caution, communication, and care. This was a significant challenge and something I hope the facility works to improve for future patients.
That said, despite this issue, I did gain a great deal from the program. The educational material, therapy sessions, and group discussions taught me valuable tools and insights that I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life. I learned about myself, my patterns, and practical ways to support my recovery going forward. Many of the staff members were compassionate and knowledgeable, and I’m genuinely grateful for those who took the time to support me.

ALL LIES! ....she's only 6 years old) i called the owner she has someone call me she said ""they do this with everyone it's no big deal they will fix it whenever they make a plan"".. later when they came to my house told me they could not do a plan because they had to correct the evaluation after i kept asking bout a plan.. weeks later the owner ""Elani"" calls me to meet me at my house she starts wanting me and my husband to make up behavior problems so she can make up a plan when we couldn't she wrote something down we don't know what. then tells me just tell the therapist what you want her to work on and she will. She constantly would question me about my daughter being homeschool and would tell me ""she cant just stay home to have school"" after 5 times i told her she isn't going to school and would keep recommending schools even thou i ask her to stop many times. She later sends out 3 different therapist the first one only wanted to work on behavior problems when she saw my daughter pee on herself she walked out. The 2nd one would only want to work 2 hours a day. The 3rd one said ""she can work the hours recommended"" but then later said ""I didn't have time"" then she later sent out a 4rd lady  she refuse to answer any questions bout herself or experience she has with kids she wouldn't even give her last name but yet she wanted to be alone with my daughter. I then told Elani bout these incidents each time and she talks to me as if it's my fault then she tells me well I have nobody else and stops contacting me.

UPDATE: As I posted this review the next day I constantly get phone calls and text from the agency bout taking this review down. I was accused of all this being my fault because i agreed to the service by signing the papers. Please be aware this company they are only out for themself they have no desire in helping your child with anything they will tell you whatever they can to get you to sign papers for service that your child will not get.",2024-07-03 10:05:36,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXSa4z12REJFfS78CRcst8cwklQcQv8Qyq_ysDDC_EtnPDK65jOXA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:04:25.205143,,

"Cornerstone Therapy Services, Inc",(321) 432-2572,ChIJVV9fljgP3ogR98MJcn9wMkk,Support Department,1,"Dear Cornerstone Therapy Team,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the way my friend has been treated by your facility. As a fellow parent, I am deeply concerned about the impact that your decisions have had on his child's well-being and progress.

He has been involved in a court-ordered 50/50 custody arrangement with his child's mother, which includes timesharing and  being allowed inclusion in therapy sessions.

Despite this, your facility has  cancelled his child's therapy sessions during his visitation times without informing him. This  shows a blatant disregard for the well-being of his child.

When he arrived at your facility today, I was shocked and disappointed to hear that he  was  told that his  child's session was cancelled and that he  was not welcome; he was beyond devastated. He  provided the court order, which clearly outlines their shared custody arrangement and the importance of both parents being involved in their child's therapy. However, your staff refused to acknowledge the order or make any exceptions.

I understand that your facility may have concerns about ""business"" or ""scheduling,"" but these concerns are trumped by the fact that you are ignoring a court order and prioritizing alleged hearsay from his child's mother over the best interests of their child. It is unacceptable that you would use unproven alleged allegations to justify penalizing his  child by cancelling sessions during his visitation times.

As a parent, he is committed to being involved in his child's life and supporting their progress. He has worked hard to establish a positive relationship with his child, and he is devastated by the way your facility has chosen to treat him. He is especially  concerned about the long-term impact that this will have on their child's well-being and mental health.

I urge you to reconsider your policies and practices regarding co-parenting and to prioritize the well-being of children over business interests. I request that you take immediate action to rectify this situation and ensure that his  child's therapy sessions are scheduled in accordance with the court order which is convenient to both parents and optimal for their child.
.
I hope that you all can work together to find a solution that prioritizes the best interests of their child. However, if not, he will be forced  to request through the courts the ability to seek alternative therapy options that respect the court order and prioritize their child's well-being. He will also be lodging complaints with the appropriate organizations.",2024-06-13 12:27:56,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLJmK_6k7v8G95GdEyuxIAFXRaZXd1rIa6CJpyNykK9FiMJiA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:04:33.381608,,

My initial lesson with the trainer, Erin, was simple and she took notes on all of Archie's quirks and issues.

Over the next few months we worked together at the complex and in our home and Erin was just so great. Archie was always very happy to see her and she provided so much helpful guidance for navigating our very stubborn, but dangerously smart, puppy. Her lessons have stuck with us through the proper reinforcement in our every day and I'm very thankful for Erin's knowledge.

The horseback riding is NOT nose to tail, though the horses are dependable.  But they do have a brain and a mind of their own, so it makes the rides fun and interesting.  After passing through a neighborhood, the rides enter the Apalachicola National Forest.  The rider can sign up for horses based on your skill and a ride based on how long you want to be in the saddle.  Many of the horses are rescues whose lives have been improved by joining the crew at Crazy 8.  You can also lease a horse from Crazy 8 and ride on your own or bring your own horse and rent space.  There are campsites available if you want to stay awhile.  The place has summer and Christmas camps for kids along with riding lessons for both adults and young people.

He is way more verbal, and his behavior has improved greatly. They were also instrumental in helping his potty training journey. The staff had always been extremely communicative, and I can see how much they truly care. I'm genuinely confused about how someone is posting that a therapist abused a child at either Largo or St. Pete locations. The therapists are in a big open room, and everyone would see if something happened. The therapist they have said has been with my son numerous times before, and he loves him. I also asked my son about the therapist today, and he said he's nice.

I don't want to discount the feelings of a mother, but I definitely would need to see some evidence as a parent of someone who also sends their child to this clinic every day. I also don't see any arrests for him in Pinellas Who's in Jail. After working Crimes Against Children for so long, I know that if you have a room full of witnesses and/or video, an arrest happens immediately. I will wait to see what the actual findings are because I've seen way too many times before that people rush to judgement before they have any facts. I have seen nothing but caring, selfless staff working here, so I'll reserve judgement.

I had them look at a sore on her leg that will not heal. So I left her with them so the vet could take a look at it since I didn’t let them know before her appointment. Which was fine. I understood. The lady called me and told me that everything will be $297 and that I could pick her up. But when I got there, the price was $500. The lady even admitted to telling me the $297 and that she didn’t understand why there was a $200 difference.

The manager comes in and tells me there was a glitch in the system. I told her I had been coming to them for four years now and asked if they could make it right for me and do everything for the $297 that I agreed upon. Then she proceeds to blame it on the receptionist was new and in training. Oh so there wasn’t really a glitch in the system? She just told me wrong. Now she was changing her reason for the misquote.

She went and got Andrew Simmons. The veterinarian. He had a short temper. He said the $500 was what you agreed upon. I said that is not true and even the lady up front told them that she had quoted me the $297 over the phone. Then I was on the phone with my husband saying that I’m going to be late to pick up my kid from preschool and he might need to go and get him. The appointment was for 10 am and by this time it was 2:20 since I had to come back. So Andrew had a slick tongue and yelled at me. He said well this was supposed to be a lot shorter. I’m like well yeah, because of you guys it’s not.

I gave them back their medication and only paid for the tests she was given. I’m going somewhere else to get her medication. I left frustrated and disappointed. It didn’t have to turn ugly. It didn’t have to be that way. Andrew has a quick temper and wouldn’t even hear me out or talk about why I was frustrated. All he did was want to yell at me. I had my two year old and my baby with me. He just stormed out of the office after.

There are other reviews that I’m seeing about this guys temper! Horrible. Save yourself the time and don’t go here. All I wanted them to do was take responsibility for their mistake since I’ve been a loyal customer with them. Don’t go here. Find somewhere that will treat their customers with respect.

Not only did she provide excellent treatment for my grandmother, who had suffered a stroke years earlier, but she also cared for all of us—on the very same day.

Before beginning any treatment, she carefully evaluated each of us. Afterwards, she went above and beyond by offering personalized aftercare—complete with recommendations and detailed exercises that she later mailed to us individually. Her approach is both effective and efficient, and I would highly recommend her, especially to anyone who takes their health seriously.

A personal detail that touched me deeply was when she had her son play with my daughter so she wouldn’t be bored while the adults were receiving treatment. That kind of thoughtfulness goes beyond medical care—it shows genuine compassion.

One who is in your corner and who will be both patient, supportive, kind and your own personal cheerleader!

I had a slip and fall accident in 2023 and felt hopeless, depressed and stiff as I laid in bed thinking this would be it for me. It was not until I met Dr. Pauline is when I had a chance at living a pain free life. She coached me through the pain by providing me daily digital exercises, along with heat therapy, massages and tailored stretches geared towards my injury.

Fast forward to February 2025, I was fortunate enough (or not so fortunate) to fall and exacerbate the same problem areas. Who did I turn to? Cutting Edge Physical Therapy!
I went from walking like a mummy to walking with confidence in just 2 sessions. It was not just the physical coaching it begins with the mind, which Dr. Pauline is sure to help you to acknowledge, accept and believe.

This is essential to the healing process as we tend to go back to old/bad habits. Her sound words fosters hope, resilience, and a positive mindset, which can significantly impact recovery and well-being.

After years of going to the same vet I decided to find something closer to home. He had been to the vet just two months prior to this appointment at Cypress Animal Hospital. For starters, my concerns were not properly addressed. Questions left unanswered. After the appointment I called back and was promised a phone call that I never received which was to answer the questions that should’ve been answered at the appointment. Dr.Ezell gave my dog a diagnosis that just 2 months ago he didnt have. A dog who has always been perfectly healthy and taken care of. She claims he has an “extremely bad” heart murmur (a 6 on a scale from 1-6) how did he go from perfectly healthy to a 6? He didn’t. Just a way to squeeze money out of us. The prices are outrageous and overall did not seem like a trustworthy place. After her insane diagnosis, I decided to get a second opinion from her previous vet and a different one as well. He does NOT have a heart murmur. Dr.Ezell wanted to “place him on medication for life”. This situation just shows she is not genuine. She’s a vet for the money she can get out of it, not to help the pets. Very inhumane if you ask me. My dog also has cataracts, he’s had it for years. She did not notice it.

DOWN RIGHT DOG TRAINING,(561) 666-8132,ChIJn6CaWeWo9wgRGjkw8w6OnFM,L B,5,"Finding the right dog trainer is like finding a needle in a haystack.
There are a lot of people who call themselves dog trainer's.
They all tend to follow cookie-cutter way of teaching.
At Down Right Dog training, it's not a business it's a passion. They make your dogs training into a game .
Your dog is playing and doesn't know he is getting trained.
They work with all size and all different breeds of dogs.
Yvan Granados is not only the highest ranked Decoy he is also a veterinarian.
No other trainer have the years of experience and the knowledge that he has.
He trains every dog based on that dog's needs ( no cookie cutter training).
We have been going to Down Right Dog training for almost 1 year.
My Belgian Malinois Roky is working on French Ring sport .
We (Roky and me )train with Yvan 2x week.
Thanks to Yvan Granados' training, Roky has
been able to overcome some issues such as dog reactivity , fear of decoy stick, and full bite suite.
Roky looks forward to his training sessions.
We will continue to training with Yvan Granados for a very long time .

The brewery is the cleanest brewery I have ever visited and that includes the two single stall room co-ed bathrooms.  Two seating areas with the bar sandwiched in-between.  There is an event room just as large as the brewery space accessible through large adjacent doors. This space is available for rent and houses local bands for customer entertainment on various nights and brewery events which include Bingo and Trivia.

The whole complex is powered by solar panels in the walkway corridor and features a food truck on most days.  The brewery has their own small offerings of food. Sorry no picts of either the food or beverage menu. However, their website is up to date with that information.

The brewmaster seems to favor IPA's with about six to seven different types. We love IPA's so this is great for us.  He also has his recipes expertly down pat. This guy has everything down to a science and all of his offerings of brews are incredible.  Sizes include 5, 10, and 16 ounce glasses with the option to get your own growler filled.   Taste samples are happily provided if unsure about making a choice.  If alcohol isn't your thing, they offer non-alcoholic beverages.

"Dalton Lewis, PT, DPT",(863) 680-7700,ChIJWev1VFVH3YgROirGfe_1nJM,John Fullerton,5,"My review is specific to the physical therapy department. I went for a shoulder problem and saw Brenna first. After that, it was mostly Casey. Both of them were great and I would like to thank Brenna and Casey for their help and guidance through my rehab.

I was able to complete my physical therapy sessions and today  I rang the bell signifying completion. I'm done! I was pleasantly surprised that after one session with Brenna and the team, my pain was reduced 50%. One session! That was amazing. Now, after a month of PT, it is not quite back to pre-therapy range of motion, but the pain is no longer there unless I really overextend my arm. I leave with 98% range of motion and almost no pain.

When I first came in, putting on a shirt or coat was like feeling knives in my shoulder. When I rolled over at night, I woke up from the sharp pains. I was uncomfortable to say the least. Now, I am able to dress without pain and sleep normally and pain free.

Since today was my last day, I needed coaching for what to do at home. Casey did a great job of coaching me how to keep stretching and improving. She gave me five new stretching exercises, which can be done as part of my home workouts. I'm confident in achieving full range of motion, that last one percent, with home stretching and exercising.

I want to add that everyone who worked with me on the Watson Clinic team was fantastic. Poor Joe was assisting me the first day and had to endure ""Joe, you are a bad man!"" jokes when the stretching hurt. But Joe, Kylie, Cory and the others were great.

This is my first time ever doing physical therapy so I don't know what I could say to improve the experience. Perhaps, letting me know up front that wearing casual clothes may be best (but not necessary) would have been nice, but I figured it out quickly.

Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere as it was positive, friendly, and encouraging. Everyone was eager to see progress and happy when it happened.

All in all, I highly recommend Brenna, Casey, Chris and the whole team at Watson Clinic Physical Therapy. You are all fantastic at your work and wonderful new friends.",2023-05-26 13:25:16,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUi8mGgNQqty1QUqEt_-QrOFhrG_t2reyrBJVbO0WlLoKH1ZQ4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:04:52.241038,,
"Dalton Lewis, PT, DPT",(863) 680-7700,ChIJWev1VFVH3YgROirGfe_1nJM,Chuck Thorpe,5,"My review is specific to the physical therapy department.
I would like to thank Chris and Sarah for the excellent care & for their outstanding help and guidance through my recovery from my knee surgery.

After one more scheduled PT I will  be complete with my scheduled physical therapy sessions for my knee surgery.
I would say I feel about 85% back to normal.

Something I was not able to do when I first started my PT was to satisfactorily bend my knee.
Now I feel that I have turned a corner & am all but where I hope to be with my total recovery.

They educated me through the process on what to do and not to do.
They made me feel confident and independent that I could achieve ongoing results on my own with a comprehensive home plan.
The detailed exercise take home printouts were extremely helpful & appreciated!!!

I always looked forward to my next appointment & very much enjoyed the very positive atmosphere & continuing encouragement, & affirmation that we “will get there!”

I highly, highly recommend Chris Ninan and Sarah at Watson Clinic Physical Therapy.

One thing that could have helped me personally would be to have had  a better clarity on which of the new exercises we do in our PT Sessions that I was to focus on to do at home & which previous one’s I was supposed to stop doing at home until my next appointment.
Having a personal cell number to be able to text Chris for clarification would have been helpful for me.
Watson Clinic’s My Chart communications are slow & has to be checked regularly, to stay current with communications.
Text messages to personal cell phones are definitely more effective.",2023-05-29 07:31:59,2 years ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK98RKVx9-bRv5UupPKo6bTZPtS9kUMNoihVCuTD0uPyy_a=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:04:52.241038,,

Three weeks later I picked up a dog that resembled mine, only he was well mannered, calm, respectful and obedient. Because I have certain physical limitations, I was truly afraid I was going to have to rehome him to keep me from being injured by his over excitement on walks and such.

I can't say enough positive things about their training program. My dog is calm and obedient ALL of the time now.

From the moment I took the tour, I knew this was the perfect place for such a special occasion. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner’s son, who took his time to walk me through the lake house and show me all the amazing amenities we could use during the party—including the refrigerator and the sound system. It was truly an awesome tour.

Arlene and the rest of the staff were absolutely wonderful. I can’t fully express how grateful and happy I was with the entire experience. The horseback riding, the interactive tour, and the petting zoo kept both the kids and adults engaged and entertained. Everyone had a fantastic time, and the children were especially impressed.

The tour was about 45 minutes and perfect for our three toddlers under three. Miss Cynthia, our tour guide, was absolutely AMAZING —so patient, informative, and gentle with the kids. She took her time to show them how to properly pet each animal, which made the whole experience extra special.

The highlights included learning all about the horses—from their colors to fun facts like “socks,” which are really just the white coloring on their feet. We loved petting the tortoises and feeding the donkeys and goats. The pig was adorable lounging by the lake, which was so beautiful to look at—we even saw ducks splashing and taking a bath!

Before coming here, I had another vet tell me my dog had only six months to live. I went to Dr. Camp for a second opinion, and he reassured me that wasn’t true. That was four years ago, and my dog is still perfectly healthy today!

While I usually see Dr. Camp, I’ve also had appointments with two of the other vets, and they were wonderful as well.

Daytona Beach Health and Rehabilitation Center,(386) 252-3686,ChIJXT6UyMLb5ogRXch3Hzbadz4,jazz lovemyparakeet,1,"Updated review: 10/8/2025 I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to be part of this amazing community and had hoped everything goes well. So far, some of the staff here is pretty good specially Hector who was the admissions coordinator and goes above and beyond to help people who are struggling and going through a difficult situation. Hector is very well spoken but no longer works there. After years of struggling but facing challenges nonetheless honestly though positive at first it quickly changed & once I saw what really happens behind closed doors and  what this place is versus how they portray themselves. My honest opinion about Daytona Beach Health and Rehabilitation Center is that they are one of the very few places in this area even all around Volusia county which does aggressive false advertisement and in reality they treat patients and staff unfairly not like a family or community members like they claim . please please stay away from them for God’s sake and your own. Unless you have no other choice. this is the worst place & read all the paperwork they ask you to sign before you are considered another for profit case. Verbal grievances or complaints or passing the blame to someone else should not have happened at all. Basic human decency and respect is lacking. Underpaid or disgruntled workers, frustrated people and poor lack of service along with inadequate services of employees on shift and other people providing services was hard to overcome . While I did meet a lot of good patients and staff. Management is totally lacking expertise and empathy. Everything is on camera but not monitored 24/7 as per staff and other patients . After reporting major safety concerns and incidents that occurred to myself and others I had to make the tough decision to discharge my self so I don’t end getting more seizures and end up in the emergency room every 2  days. I went in on oct 1st and once the tipping point was reached I left on the 7th. On the 3 after the second seizure and fall, it took 30 mins of lack of communication and decision making by staff members involved to call 911. My date of birth was incorrect inspite of my requests from day 1 among other things. Sorry this is not what I signed up for. I don’t want to get into any more specifics or drama because in life I learned the hard way that for profit agencies only care about you if you bring in money. They lie through their teeth and pretend to care. It’s sad that in 2025, this can still happen! May Hector be happy wherever he goes and hadn’t been treated the way NHS did after 9 months of hardwork. No one knows who is above Lori the administrator and the information of corporate or higher ups. Every error is blamed on someone else and there is no accountability even though there are cameras everywhere. Just sad and unnecessary. I hope I don’t ever have to go back to put up with all the stress, drama and lies. The services provided are excellent and affordable.The work ethic is not very good and they are not very knowledgeable or professional. Hector was a good staff member who worked hard to make sure everyone is happy and well taken care of. It’s hard to find someone who is honest and trustworthy as well as experienced in this field but still has a lot of empathy and compassion. Though I was under the impression that everyone I met at this facility is very kind  but I learned the truth after 7 days. The stuff no one tells you about. This post might be deleted soon but I don’t care anymore. May God bless you all and guide you always. Hector helped me overcome a lot of challenges and was very supportive throughout the whole process but the pressure was too much and he just quit. I am sad and pray for all who were here or are now or will be here for the future. Thank you for everything. If you know you know. Google their real reviews. The citations, the patient complaints and even lawyers in town. Since when this business was opened and till now they have become one of the worst places for senior citizens and law abiding citizens like me.

Jake is 15 years old and jumped off the couch,not really sure how he even got up there and hurt his rear legs. I called this place to get some advice. I spoke with Joanne who runs the rescue and cannot tell you what a pleasure it was. She's very compassionate and extremely knowledgeable about dog's. She even offered to send Jake to her own vet and help with expenses. Never have I felt such warmth from someone in this field.  She went above and beyond to get me information on Jake's situation.

I reached out to Early Steps, part of Orlando Health and the Howard Phillips Center, for support with my medically complex 7-month-old daughter. After 3.5 months in the NICU and multiple surgeries, I was desperate for real help.

My husband and I work remotely but my work schedule is less demanding. After waiting 3 months to be scheduled, my day nurse and I attend this virtual meeting with Jennifer Galindez, Lora Torres, and Mary Marshall for my daughter’s evaluation. During the virtual intake, I mentioned giving my daughter a taste of peanut butter and banana. The team never asked how. They assumed I was feeding her spoonfuls and reported me to DCF the next day.

I was horrified. DCF came to my home unannounced. They photographed my baby, her room, and feeding tools. Three days later the case was closed, found to be unfounded—but the trauma remains.

Early Steps caused more harm than help. They do not offer hands-on therapy, and their staff lacks the compassion and communication skills required to work with families like ours. Be careful before trusting them with your child’s care.",2025-06-13 15:51:22,4 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWctP0thbqFns7r_A9i5_Pi8RD_FIeM0Hu_SNN7EhppwwTz5VS_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:05:08.577580,,

I appreciate the fact that I have the option to sign Abbey up for on- going refresher training or enrichment activities during boarding or daycare.  These courses have made a tremendous difference with my girl.  If you've ever owned a guardian breed, you know how stubborn they can be.  They need routine, positive training and commitment from their owners to build good manners with obedience.  It's a journey and can be achieved with the right training program.  I have the highest respect for Tracey, Nicole and her entire staff at DK9!   The work they do with canine training - especially large, guardian breeds it's incredible.   My Abbey listens very well.

My neighbors certainly did! However, Josephine, the owner and lead trainer, proved them wrong!!

Storm, our 11 year old rescue, was out of control when anyone rang the front door bell. He would charge ahead of us, and bark aggressively…non stop.  After only 2 lessons with Josephine using DTE’s proven methods, and us reinforcing them daily, Storm now stays in his “place” when the doorbell rings, and is learning to be “quiet”.

We just finished the 5th lesson, and we can confidently and safely walk Storm by our side around our neighborhood. He “heels”, is not pulling, or distracted by other dogs and is focused on the commands. If we stop, and he’s told “down”, he goes down with chest and elbows on the ground. This is the hardest command to follow as it means total submission by him.

We highly recommend Josephine and her side-kicks, Gracie and Dottie :) The DTE program she is using was developed over 45 years. We learnt that success with Storm would only be possible with mutual trust, consistency, positive reinforcement, and most of all…working with him at least 15 minutes everyday.

My dog Oreo has some behavioral issues with whining, excessive energy, and destructive behavior at times. I met with multiple trainers before Paul, all said the same thing: Oreo needs more exercise, or an e-collar, or wanted thousands for a board and train program. All Oreo needed was structure and guidance, and that is what Paul offered.

In two hours, Paul addressed all my concerns and issues and gave me the knowledge I needed to work successfully with him. From the moment Paul stepped in and started working with  Oreo, I saw a major difference. He went from whining and jumping to being quiet, peaceful, and calm. When we went outside and started the heel process, I thought I was looking at a brand-new dog, it was a complete 180 from the walk we had that morning. After that day, Paul was there to answer my questions and to check in on Oreo's progress and was even willing to meet again to help me.

Overall, choosing Paul was the best decision for me and Oreo. He has changed the relationship I have with Oreo for the better. I see it, and others around me see it as well.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and quite amazed at how impactful that 2 hours was.

Our family of five sat around the living room and Paul gave us such amazing insight and provided some examples and taught our family, children included, how to interact with the puppy while providing “correction”. There was a great improvement in several areas of our dog’s behavioral issues before Paul left.

The continued “training” is so effortless and simple that it does not feel like a chore at all. Thank you so much Paul. Our dog is already so much better behaved and she will only get better. Having a calm, well behaved dog is a gift that keeps giving for years to come.

It was extremely frustrating and exhausting, constantly avoiding dogs. I couldn’t go anywhere with my boy, he was extremely reactive to any dog in sight, and this severely limited the things we could do together. Now, because of dogspeak, we are going on pack walks with his dog friends!!

Elizabeth Snyder and each person on the team at dogspeak are passionate members of the dog world, and do an incredible job with both dogs and owners. Elizabeth helped me take my nervous boy from reactive and stressed, to a calm and happy companion. I will be forever grateful, because now I can have my best friend with me everywhere I go, without the fear of him reacting.

DogSpeak,(850) 688-6239,ChIJmRNLYONVz0URTzT1xf5Lv8M,Shairi Turner,5,"Draco is our 20 month old half pitbull half Belgian Malinois. Raised and partially trained in DC. He was re-homed to us. He was loving but super energetic, always jumping up and very mouthy. (Wanting to put his mouth on everyone). Always demanding attention when we were working from home.  He had selective listening. Beth asked us: “Is there anything he will do 100% of the time?”
Nope. That’s when we knew we needed DogSpeak.

In 4 weeks of Board and train he is a different dog. He no longer jumps up. No more biting. He can walk off leash and follows all commands (No, heel, come, sit, place etc). But even more amazing is that he now entertains himself. Finds his ball, plays with his bone, takes his naps when he wants them. Unbelievable. He even achieved his AKC Canine Good Citizen ribbon before we took him home!
If you have a high drive dog, don’t bother with traditional training. It won’t work and everyone will be frustrated.

In looking around for some help in raising a puppy, I found Doglando- quite literally a little slice of Heaven for dogs, and the most wonderful “village” to support Cowboy and I in his development that I could have ever asked for! Cowboy started out at Doglando at around 5 months of age (he’s 2 years old now), entering the Pre-K9 Level 1 program. This program involved him going 3 days a week, focusing on enrichment one day a week, skill building the other 2 days. Some of his skill building days consisted of recall, crate + pedestal exercises, physical handling (massage/settle, which he just eats up now), just to name a few! Along with the Pre-K9 Level 1 & 2 program, came weekly group classes, where I learned and worked on building a relationship with Cowboy, absorbing all of the training info to use throughout the week at home! Now at 2 years old, Cowboy and I are going on all sorts of off leash adventures, that I have more confidence embarking on with him than I could have ever imagined!! All thanks to the weekly Pre-K9 classes and the work we’ve been able to do on our own to further strengthen what we’ve learned.

Doglando’s Pre-K9 programs were quite honestly life-changing. They established a wonderful sense of community, and have educated me on so much regarding dogs’ needs and the lifestyle for them Doglando lives by! If it weren’t for them, Cowboy and I wouldn’t have half the adventures and relationship we have today!! The staff at Doglando is so wonderful, they all love their job tremendously and want only the very best for the dogs- it shows big time! Cowboy is always so excited to see them at Doglando and out in public at any events!! He knows the turns that lead to Doglando all too well, sleeping peacefully in the car until we get to East Colonial, immediately sitting up in the seat, eager for us to pull into a parking spot and go see all of his favorite humans and dog friends! Along with, running around with giant sticks the handlers bring to his attention, meditating in the pond, enjoying all of the elements and space Doglando provides!!

When we first began looking for a doggy day care to bring our pup to when we are at work, there was no comparison. Most other places were overcrowded and only had a small turf area for the pups to play in. In addition, Moose was able to join the pre-k course and get puppy training as well. When my husband and I went on the tour of Doglando, we left there saying how Doglando was like a heaven for dogs—acres of open grass, woodlands, water areas, and even a sand yard and obstacle course for the pups to play in!

Not only is the enrichment center amazing, but the individuals who work here are even more incredible. Moose’s body always starts wiggling uncontrollably when we pull up to Doglando because he is so excited to be there! You can tell how caring and thoughtful everyone is from the pure look of excitement on his face when he sees the team. Not only does this team love Moose like I do when he is there, but the team has gone above and beyond to help guide me throughout the nutty puppy (and now adolescent) trouble stages that we go through.

Caring individuals are always actively working with the dogs so they can better adapt to their human’s life. The dogs safety, health and well-being is Doglando’s number one priority. From providing dogs with quality food and fresh water, to making sure all dogs are up to date on vaccines and that the campus is free of harmful bacteria/parasites that may reside in the “wild”.

He was out of control and no matter what we did we could not get him to stop counter surfing, jumping on the couch and beds, jumping on people, constantly grabbing laundry out of the laundry hamper, grabbing the hand rags off the counter… the list goes on!!  Having 2 smaller kids made it really tough for us to give Cooper the proper training he needed. We researched trainers in our area and what the training was like. Tracy had a great reviews and we watched her videos on her website. We knew she was going to be the best trainer for Cooper. We did the 3 week training and my husband and I could not be any happier with the results. When he came home he was a different dog, much well behaved. We stuck with the training she taught us when she brought Cooper back home. She didn’t only train Cooper she taught us on how to continue with the training him so he didn’t go back to his bad habits. 4 weeks later with having Cooper home, he is still doing great! Having Copper trained by Dogs in Bloom was the best decision we have made in a long time and it was worth every penny.

Mt husband is deployed and I work in the ER for 12 hr shifts with a six year old to juggle and I have brought my dogs to pretty much every boarding/daycare place around Jax. NEVER ONCE HAVE THEY BEEN SO HAPPY SO WELL BEHAVED AT HOME (which is a godsend because at that point I am exhausted). The moment we pull into the parking lot they start to wiggle their whole bodies and cannot wait to get inside and play! They always look and smell so wonderful when I pick them up and I can tell both the dogs absolutely adore the staff (i usually have to walk with them to the dog entrance of any dog daycare to get them to be okay to leave me). The staff is beyond accommodating and works with my schedule and truly give my dogs so much love and attention I have noticed such an improvement in their overall happiness and behavior in just three sessions being here!  They are constantly playing and only have them in a small area for meals and a small break, otherwise they are outside or inside playing ALL DAY. I check the video cameras and love seeing them so happy and socializing. I would recommend this location to ALL dog owners they truly go above and beyond in every way and have exceeded my expectations more than I am able to put into words. We have been going through a rough patch and not being able to be home as much as usual was too hard on my high energy dogs and now with Dogtopia I am not stressed or worried about them at all and they come home and completely pass out. ONE OF THE BEST PARTS is the affordability for the incredible care they receive. I have paid double or more at other places and they are put in kennels for long periods of time during the day but not at dogtopia! My only regret is not finding them sooner!! Anthony , Lilac, Jacob thank you for being so helpful and welcoming and the two dog experts i had on Saturday the 21st who came in early and stayed late you deserve the recognition for your work and assistance and I feel terrible I cannot remember your names.

It was a visit to hopefully board him for my vacation at the end of the month. A few days later he starts acting strange. He picked up giardia. The infection spread and in a really freak and very quick chain of events he developed pneumonia. His kidneys failed his white blood cells were depleted and this turned into a pyothorax which led to sepsis and he passed away. I have no way to absolutely prove this is where it came from but he had literally gone nowhere else and only briefly went outside to pee and poop on a leash due to the heat over the past couple weeks. The timing and incubation period is too precise to be coincidental. I immediately took him to the vet at the onset of the symptoms but it was too late. Despite spending thousands to try to save his life he passed away. I'm honestly devastated. Please quadruple check that you are sanitizing everything.

What stood out the most was his ability to listen with compassion while also providing clear, practical guidance. It’s rare to find a provider who can balance empathy with no-nonsense advice, and Dr. Perez does exactly that.

As a Latina, it was especially meaningful to connect with a provider who understands cultural background and nuances. That sense of connection and cultural awareness made the entire experience even more comfortable and supportive.

I have dealt with intermittent lower back pain for over a decade. After a particularly bad episode that left me barely able to walk a few feet without pain, I was referred to Dr. Dan by a family member.

Our initial consult was over the phone. Dr. Dan was attentive and asked thoughtful, probing questions to truly understand what I was going through. He did not rush the conversation and made me feel heard from the start.

When I visited him in person at his studio, he spent a full two hours carefully assessing me. He genuinely wanted to understand the root causes of my pain. Throughout the assessment, he explained in detail why my body was reacting the way it was. That educational component was invaluable. It was not just about what I needed to do; it was about why it would help.

At the end of the assessment, he laid out a clear 12-week plan, discussed potential outcomes, and gave me targeted mobility and strength exercises to get started right away. He set realistic expectations but also gave me hope and confidence in the process.

Now, after several weeks, I feel stronger. If I do get lower back tweaks, they are not as painful and the pain dissipates quickly. It is a radical improvement over where I was just a few weeks ago. There's more sessions to go and I know I'll only improve more and more.

After getting my test results back on 9/24/25 and having negative side effects from the prescribed medication that the Dr told me to call them if it were to occur, When I called to speak with the doctor the FIRST time I was instantly placed on hold for 1 hour 10 minutes and 41 seconds, during which i called back with my other phone to see what was going on. Iggy/Izzy or whatever her name is answered the phone with an attitude as if I was bothering her, then when I asked if its customary to place a patient on hold for over an hour without even checking in on them from time to time or God Forbid that she get up and tell the Dr that her patient is having a bad reaction and is very concerned about his diagnosis, NO, she proceeds to tell me that she did her job by transferred me and that she did not put me on hold and that it wasn't her fault that the Dr didn't answer with the mist disgusting attitude ever. I left my name and phone number with her to have the Dr. Call me back to go over my side effects and my diagnosis and i have yet to receive a phone call to this day 9/30/25. So I ended up going the ER and was given additional medication and was given documentation in regards to my concern. It is so unfortunate that this 1 representative has tarnished my relationship with your company.

"Dr. Jennifer Brandon, Chiropractor",(239) 329-8987,ChIJ_wyjHJpH24gR3-udplnNGFU,Lara Williamson,5,"First off, I wish I could give 100 stars! Dr. Brandon is so amazing where do I even begin? I had been a patient (a VERY inconsistent patient) for the last two years. I would go to get adjusted along with my daughter (3) and son (9). I could always tell a difference after visiting but just didn't make regular chiropractic care a priority until April of this year. I was in a head on collision at no fault of my own this April and was 23 weeks pregnant at the time. It left my car totaled and my body very banged up.

Being that I was 23 weeks pregnant the overall consensus from any doctor I spoke to was we can't help you until after the baby is born. I was left with whiplash, back pain, and severe pelvic pain which was terrifying given that we are on a countdown to me giving birth. It was very discouraging, until I went back to Dr. Brandon.

Flash forward a month and a half. I have seen Dr. Brandon 2-3 a week and what a lifesaver and MIRACLE worker she has been. I still have a way to go to be back at 100%, but every time I am adjusted I can feel a difference for the better. This is my third pregnancy and for the first time I have people asking me, how do you feel so good? How are you so comfortable at this stage and moving around so easily? I give most of the credit to Dr. Brandon. This is my first pregnancy with regular adjustment and the first pregnancy where I still feel amazing at 30 weeks AND after a bad car accident!

Every time my pelvic pain comes back, one trip to see Dr. Brandon and the pain is gone! Her continued care has greatly improved my quality of life in more ways than helping heal the injuries from the accident. I have always suffered from horrible allergies and congestion, issues that are almost completely nonexistent after her routine chiropractic care.

Let's not forget to mention she is also beyond amazing with children. Patient, kind, and so gentle, there isn't anyone else I would trust my littles with! I cannot wait to bring our newest addition for his adjustments with Dr. B! If you've been searching for a great family chiropractor then search NO MORE!!!

Not only is he really skilled at his craft, but also he's a good guy and hilarious. Win win.

I went to the chiropractor who then sent me to Dr. Rob and he tried so many different therapies to get this muscle to ease up. It took several sessions (sans insurance at that!) but I didn't actually do the home exercises until it got acute (my bad). In retrospect, I reaaaally wish I had just listened to him and started those earlier because I'm pretty sure it was the combo of the exercises + the last few sessions with Dr. Rob that finally healed my injury!!! It only took 4 months (I legit thought it was permanent) but I'm so grateful Dr. Rob was relentless in trying to figure out how to get to the bottom of it.

The place is very clean.. spacious.. carefully designed to do the job. Our puppy did the three weeks obedience training. He did a lot of leash pulling, barking at everything/everyone, not being comfortable around other dogs. By week one his behavior had already transformed tremendously and it just got better as time passed. Still the same sweet puppy but with noticeable discipline. With every visit we learned everything that was added to the training and worked with him one on one. The last class was at home where Jorge took the time to help create a safe space and routine as well as walking with us in the neighborhood to teach us how to use the puppy and our new skills outdoors too.

A Game-Changer for Our Family and Our Pup!

When we noticed that Alpy, our Micro Bernedoodle, was no longer responding to commands and had developed some challenging behaviors, like constant barking and jumping, we knew we needed help. That’s when we discovered Duran K9 Training on social media.

After watching several of their videos, it was clear we had made some early mistakes, like giving Alpy too much freedom too soon. Their content alone was incredibly eye-opening, and we immediately felt this was the right place for us.

Alpy spent **three weeks at their training facility**, and the transformation was unbelievable. He came back a completely different dog, focused, responsive, and so much more in tune with us. He now follows commands instantly, and even when he tests boundaries, a single correction is all it takes.

We are beyond happy and grateful for Jorge and the entire Duran K9 team. They not only took excellent care of Alpy, but gave us the tools, structure, and guidance we needed to strengthen our bond and truly communicate with our pup.

Thanks to their program, the stress and frustration have turned into joy and confidence.

The course was held in an outdoor pavilion. Upon arrival there were childrens preschool dividers separating the dogs, 9 dogs. This was not a good solution. They attempted to put my 95lb dog and I in the middle of the pavilion with only 3 sides. When that didn't go well, they seemed very bothered that we had to rearrange the dogs to accommodate us.
This is the description of the class. ""This reactive dog training course is a specialized training program designed to help dogs who exhibit reactive behavior, such as excessive barking, lunging, or growling in response to specific triggers. This class employs positive reinforcement techniques to teach dogs alternative.""  My dog is adopted and leash aggressive with other dogs. This setup is not condusive to dogs with actually aggression. We got very little individual instruction. Throwing food on the ground is the main technique used to distract your dog. My dog is VERY good motivated but was so overwhelmed she didn't care about hotdogs. The second class she expected us to start walking our dogs past each other. That was definitely NOT happening for at least 3 of the 8 dogs. When Jamie came to check in with us and I told her that my dog was struggling with this food on ground distraction technique. She told me that I needed to put my dog on medication! I'd literally spoken to this woman 3 times for less than 10 total. There an on boarding zoom call. The zoom call with 8 pet guardians was completely unproductive and Jamie clearly hadn't actually listened to what the dogs actual issues were. She didn't even suggest individual training. Just straight to medicating my dog. My dog is not aggressive in general. She lives with a kitten. I was so shocked that this was her best advice for me. I wrote to Peggy Adams and told them that the class wasn't a good fit for my dog. They graciously refunded the entire amount of the class.

Early Steps,(727) 767-4403,ChIJ9VRhdI_hwogRGkAlH5tF_yI,Amber Miller,1,"At first I was unsure about the program. After waiting for them to contact me for over a month I was finally able to get in touch with them myself. I was given the number of a woman named Erica who was going to be the coordinator. She stated my sons dr gave her the wrong contact information for me... ok whatever I let it slide. After that things seemed like they were looking up. I took my son to the evaluation where I was told they had 30 days to find him a provider. After that I never heard anything else. So after 2 weeks I contacted them. Erica told me she should be hearing back from a provider by the end of that day and then she would contact me. Of course she never did. As the 30th day approached I messaged Erica again asking what was going on. Then she was a little rude with me stating that she told me she would call me when she found someone. Which is not at all what she had originally told me. So on the 30th day she finally said she found someone and that the therapist would contact me. The therapist contacted me the following day and made an appointment for 10:00 AM on a Monday. At 9:30pm!!!!! Sunday night she texted me to inform me that she had to reschedule for 1:00 Monday instead of 10am which I was fine with considering I took the entire day off from work anyway. Then at 12:30pm on Monday, 30 minutes before the appointment she texted me again canceling and said she would call me that evening to reschedule, she never called. The following day I messaged her and asked when we could reschedule. At that point she told me the coordinator would be in touch with me. So now I still have no idea what is going on. They only provide service until 3 and my son will be 3 in March. They have dragged this process out so far that now they won’t have to give him service at all!!!!

After asking at least 15 times if I could call back and starting an argument with me she told me she’s canceling our referral, which she obviously didn’t even read because she didn’t even know the problems we were referred for which are clearly written in a referral from the pediatrician. She basically argued with me for 8 minutes and hung up on me.

Elevate Recovery Lounge,(386) 387-8414,ChIJS2gr737d5ogRPhuWA5yngBk,Ada M,5,"The Elevate lounge is not just a recovery space; it offers so much more, from the cold plunge that I only regret for a millisecond after diving in, to the sauna that I eagerly anticipate enjoying after my workout. There's also the red light therapy that aids in alleviating my muscle soreness and enhancing my skin's appearance.

Elevate is truly special. As soon as I enter my 4-digit code, I know that during my time in the room, I can set aside all my daily worries and concerns. To be honest, I do bring both of my phones with me, but being in that space puts me in a different mindset. You really have to experience it for yourself. I could write endlessly about the Elevate lounge, but unless you try it yourself, you won't fully understand.

A major advantage is that you can personalize your experience; you can access the room anytime with your unique 4-digit code and enjoy this oasis that is safe, convenient, and an affordable investment in yourself—you definitely won't regret it! Another huge plus is its proximity to the gym; it’s literally right next door.

After not receiving any more paperwork, links or any messages from them, I called today at 2:15 to find out what is going on with my appointment. The receptionist  was completely nonchalant in her attitude about it but looked up my information. She kept insisting they had sent me paperwork today at 1:40 p.m. through text message and it had been "" clicked"" on. I explained to her that I had not received anything from them through text or email. I had put my email address on the original online paperwork but she insisted that it was missing so we added it. There goes my confidence in their office staff, billing etc.

My biggest concern is her lack of empathy, apology, or concern that a potentially new( psych ) patient didn't receive  their appointment paperwork so they could be seen at their 1st appt and why does her computer say delivered, yet the patient is showing different?
According to her, they didn't have my email address on file either. I had put it in the original online paperwork. One mistake after another !!
She was cold and  cared less about me as a patient. She should not be in a CS position  especially in a psychiatric office. I was honestly a little upset and because I was having to reschedule for 2 weeks later. I mentioned to her that this was triggering my Bipolar and was not a good way to start a new relationship with a new therapist and their staff. She reminded me I could always go somewhere else.
So after so many red flags and hearing that, I don't think I want to waste my time and emotions going through all the initial start up conversation that goes with starting with a new therapist.

Therapy has been wonderful and 5 star service BUT psychiatry has been horrible. I’m also a registered nurse and it’s sad what I have experienced here. They made a huge mistake for my care and in the process created more problems. They made me wait two months to see a new provider. The original one didn’t help me find good meds for postpartum at all. When asked to see another psychiatrist, they scheduled me for a new visit 2 months out. I patiently wait and come that day it’s the same freaking psychiatrist that I asked to not see anymore. I know….shocking. Again, I was patient. They rescheduled me for another two months out and have been giving me such a hard time getting a refill of my antidepressant. After a week of calls from me and the pharmacy in which I ran out of meds, they finally called in a 30 day supply…..meaning I’ll have to jump though these hoops again in 3 weeks since they can’t get me a follow up. So I will not have seen a doctor for 4 months while starting a new medication. Seems completely unethical and their fault. They need to know what they are doing to people.

Exactly a year ago our son who was not even 4 years old was evaluated and accepted as a special case under doctor Barrett!

Where we were last year was dark, scary, lonely, exhausting, and hopeless. Our son needed help and his pediatrician knew it too. No psychiatrist would take him in due to age. It was a miracle to find Dr Barrett at Ormond Beach. One short in person visit, she saw how much our little boy needed early intervention that everyone else refused to offer. Our son has moderate autism and was non verbal. Along with a family history of bipolar disorder his father has. He unfortunately is developmentally delayed by a year due to these significant battles. He would self harm and harm others. He had seizures. He would cry and scream as if he was trapped in a box and could not get out.
She is an Angel! Dr. Barrett on every visit I let her know our gratitude for her time and goals she has for our son. He is 4.5 years old today and is no where near the child you saw a year ago! With her help we have him stable and she gave our little boy back to us! He is catching up like the turtle who wins the race at his own pace. But none of this could have been possible without her help. She was our only source of early intervention and she deeply cares about her patients like her own children or family.
Now our whole family see’s her. Our daughter for ADHD and my husband for his bipolar management.
I cannot thank Elite DNA enough for passing our son’s first evaluation for the doctors to view and the one that gave my son a chance of a normal childhood was Dr. Barrett.

We highly recommend this office at Ormond Beach! The front desk staff are always so kind and very understanding of scheduling as well. We have never had any issues.

As I said, it has been over a year. We will not be going anywhere!

Thank you Dr. Barrett again for helping our family. We thank God for you every day as we see our son Zyler, blossom and thrive. None of it would be possible without you!

If I could give 10 stars vs 5 I would!

I want to preface this with my negative review has nothing to do with my provider; she is wonderful and I'd still be seeing her if I had my old insurance. However, if you do not have insurance, expect to be charged an asinine amount to see your provider for 10 minutes and not be able to reach billing after calling 3 times in a week. I saw my provider last in February when I still had my old insurance and it was a very short visit. I did not follow-up in March because I got new insurance and was charged a $40 no-show fee. Understandable and this is industry standard. However, a little over a week ago I was sent a notice that I would be charged $450 for my visit in February. Not only is $450 for a single appointment an insane amount (and my provider is likely only making $60 an hour, if that, so where is the rest of the money going???) but Elite DNA failed to get this amount covered by my insurance back in February when I was still covered! All of my appointments had been previously covered and I wasn't charged a dime. The icing on the cake is that I got this notification and 5 days later $275 was taken out of my bank account by Elite DNA, and another $175 this morning. My account was nearly overdrawn and there is literally nothing you can do to stop them from charging you if you give them your card info. Do NOT do this! This all could be a horrible misunderstanding on my end but their billing department won't call me back, so here I am with $450 less in my bank account for a 10 minute appointment in February that was taken out of my account by them on a five days notice.

She walked into the lobby, found the patient and told her she would not be able to see her today because it was too late. As if the patient was late and not her office being unorganized. That alone upset me. These appointments are important for continuing medication that cannot be stopped abruptly. This provider did not agree with the 2 previous Providers I’ve seen over the last 10 years. She went on to tell me everything that these providers were doing incorrectly. She even had the audacity to tell me after asking 10 questions that my diagnosis was incorrect. The same diagnosis that took me 2 years in a chair with a psychotherapist working closely with a psychiatrist to obtain. I have also been sent to other specialist to obtain other diagnosis that I have been living comfortably with to for some time now. Think this is my first appointment I did not want to change any of my medication’s. Unfortunately, that decision was not up to me. Cassandra Melton Refused to prescribe me the same medication I Have been prescribed for over 10 years. She decreased a prescription That has serious side effects if not weaned appropriately by 75%. This is extremely dangerous. Fortunately, I know how dangerous this could be, and I brought this to her attention. She does not agree. Her lack Of basic knowledge highlights her inexperience. If you are considering Looking for a new provider I would look elsewhere. I’ve tried to work with Cassandra Melton To make me feel comfortable with the new prescription regimen however her lack of experience keeps her ignorant. I am concerned that she can Be so comfortable with diagnosing someone on the first visit, but Not trusting years of Records Supporting said diagnosis. I believe this woman Is endangering her patients Because she personally is not comfortable with their regimen. I also can’t shake the feeling of being judged while sitting in her office. Please keep in mind. I did not prescribe any of these medication’s that I am currently on to myself. This current regimen was created by a team of doctors. I’ve worked with for several years. She wanted me to take a drug test before she would prescribe me controlled substances. Fine.
At the very same time that I was in her office, there was another new patient in the office beside me Who had not been to a provider in almost 10 years, had Not been prescribed medication in almost 10 years. That patient walked out with a controlled prescription in hand that day at her first appointment. I walked out feeling. Shameful, Scared and vulnerable. She did see a different provider than I. I don’t recommend this office to anyone. Lastly, I made a complaint to the head office and never received a response.",2025-05-13 12:20:08,5 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKS5U5A8fn1n2c1byfYPWTXT8bxdehJMIppeLwq4mxLUaHPvQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:05:58.256292,,
Elite DNA Behavioral Health Therapy & Psychiatry Clinic - Tallahassee,(850) 671-4600,ChIJA-95oBpf7IgRXTFqPV67UJo,Mary Hendry,1,I do recommend Elitte DNA — but pray you don’t have to call and speak to their front desk person who appease or acts like she is working at retail store and NOT a mental health providers office -  she appears to not have mental health training -  she was very rude - zero empathy zero compassion no clue what patients she is trying to help.  I would recommend their front office person should have some type of mental health briefing training education- because there is no way at this time the current person has any of this! My providers here are AMAZING - I see Dr Sharon and my therapist is from the Jacksonville office.  Today we unacceptable treatment by the person taking the calls.  I had to call in and very politely and calmly explained my issue in full detail - she said she needed to speak my provider and her manager about what was happening with the telehealth app not allowing me to log in - she left me on hold for 23 mins NEVER COMING BACK to even just check in — I used a 2nd phone to call and she answered asked me to hold - I did let her know … you already have me on hold for 23 mins on a different phone right now — her response was “ this is mary” .. I said yes this is mary … then said she was waiting for my provider and her manager to respond then proceeded to give me INCORRECT information and had explained exactly what the issue was—- she started arguing with me and telling me repeatedly that I was wrong and over speaking me and now I’m triggered arguing with her she’s still over speaking me not allowing me to talk and while I’m still speaking continuously says “ are you are you don’t dare you done are you done “ like a 5 year old and after her saying this numerous times I said NO IM NOT DONE .. she also said “ you supposed 23 mins hold “ excuse me .. supposed .. i had to use another phone line to call back due to still being I. The 23 mins hold at that time of the 2nd call from another phone—- again providers aaaamazing but pray you do not have call !!!,2025-07-23 10:25:02,2 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW9Jy0l0YUC0riUiJc2prJDh2He258argUbyTKzaQLOItt_2YV5XQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3,2025-10-13 18:05:58.256292,,

I couldn’t be happier with our dog training experience! From the very first session, the trainer was professional, patient, and clearly passionate about helping dogs and their owners. They took the time to understand my dog’s personality and tailored the training to fit his needs.

What really stood out was how easy the trainer made everything to follow. The instructions were clear, practical, and broken down into simple steps that made it fun for both me and my dog. I could see improvement right away—he’s already responding better to commands and seems more confident.

The sessions were positive, encouraging, and built on trust rather than fear or strict discipline. My dog absolutely loves training now, and I feel much more confident handling him.

I highly recommend this training service to anyone who wants to strengthen their bond with their dog while seeing real results. Truly a wonderful experience!

Elite Professional Dog Training,(407) 732-4437,ChIJPfmDr-Vu54gRX66ko24QhUI,Wendy Piazza,5,"Laurent and his team at Elite are the BEST!!!  Over the past 3 years, I have taken my 2 giant schnauzers to train with Laurent.  With both dogs being 100+ lbs, it was critical that they (and us as the parents) were well trained and could handle and be comfortable in any situation/environment.

In 2021, I took Ellie when she was 10 months old for the Doggy Boot Camp.  She trained (and stayed) at the facility for 6 weeks, and came home a different dog, with manners and understanding of what was expected of her.  The home training provided at the end of the program was critical to our success of following thru with training at home.  She continues to go to Doggy Day Care a few times a week and is a happy well-rounded girl.

In November 2023, we adopted 1.5 year old Bentley (who had some previous training), but appeared aggressive towards individuals upon first meeting.  I RAN to Elite for a consult, and ultimately enrolled in the 4-week Train and Play program.  Bentley goes everyday (M - F) for training and socialization with other pups.  He is such a smart boy, and really wants to please with whatever you ask him to do.  The training isn't over yet, but the results and feedback that we get from Elite each week are phenomenal!

I can't recommend the Elite program(s) enough!  They are experts at what they do, really dig in to understand your fur baby (and you as their human), and then BAM....make the magic happen!",2023-12-29 09:12:10,a year ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIJ2iH1H3JLC2GP8cmSLbnqbfGdi9Wg2xGvCc3VYoI3Z419TA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo,2025-10-13 18:06:01.833301,,

They truly transformed our walks with Teddy (Our stubborn adorable 4 year old Frenchie), who was very dog reactive. From the first session, Laurent and Josh’s expertise and understanding of dog behavior shone through. They tailored the training specifically for Teddy, addressing his issues with patience and effective techniques.

What I really appreciated were the regular updates and videos. It was great to see Teddy's progress in real time—both the good moments and the challenging ones. This transparency helped us understand the training process and made us feel more involved.

Now, our walks are a joy! Teddy is much more relaxed and obedient, responding well to commands and staying focused. It’s incredible to see the progress he’s made.

If you’re looking for a reliable and effective training service, I highly recommend Elite Professional. They not only took care of Teddy’s reactiveness but also enriched our bond with him.

Ms. Hunnie was a show dog since she was 5 months old. Once she retired, I noticed that she still had show dog mentality and was very stubborn, especially if she wasn’t being shown by her handler.

I love my fur baby and I want to continue to enjoy her. I knew that this transition was new to her as well as to us, and I needed help.

I didn’t just want anyone to help us with this new transition from being a show dog  to a loving, obedient, well-trained dog that we can enjoy inside our home and outside of our home.

After doing thorough research, we located Elite Professional Dog Training LLC
5001 North Ronald Reagan Blvd
Sanford , Florida 32773.
We met with the trainer, Laurent Gabriel, and Josh.  We watched the interactions with our fur baby, Ms. Hunnie, and they not only won her over but us as well.

We decided on the Boot Camp 4-6 weeks, which meant she had to stay. But I will let you know that was very hard as well; however, the staff kept us updated with an update regularly. They even put up with me calling every single day until I became more comfortable. They also sent videos and pictures of her progress regularly.

I know this was a long review, but if you love your fur baby as I do, give them the extra love they need to be happy.

My partner and I rescued Greta last November. She had been in a kill shelter in Clayton County, Georgia before a rescue in Ocala, Florida picked her up. Since the day we got her, we knew she was extremely smart. Almost too smart..lol. She was an extremely sweet girl around humans but struggled mainly with resource guarding and reactivity toward other dogs.

My boyfriend and I found Laurent and Elite online and it was single-handedly the best decision we've made for our girl. After giving her a home of course. After our consultation, Laurent suggested we enroll Greta in their train-and-play program so she could work on her socialization with other dogs along with learning essential commands. Not only did he train Greta, but us as well. He helped us be able to understand and communicate with Greta more. Laurent made it possible for Greta to trust us, listen to us, know when it's time to go wild and when it's time to reel it in, and most excitedly for us as dog parents, watch her play with other dogs. She truly is a whole new dog.

We now take Greta to daycare almost every single weekday. She has the best doggy friends, she loves Laurent and all of the staff at Elite, and she gets excited every day to go to Elite.

Whatever your dog is struggling with, Laurent, Josh, and everyone at Elite are the best people to help. They understand dog behaviors and help you understand them too.

When I told her some of the answers of those questions didn’t make sense or fit the questions, she got offended and snapped back that “these are the GAD-7 standard questions.” After about 15 minutes, she just said, “Boom, you have ADHD,” and wanted to prescribe Adderall.

To make it worse, they forgot to even send my prescription to the pharmacy, and now I keep calling but they won’t answer or call me back.

She did the due diligence of learning who I am, the goals I would like to meet and the activities I enjoy doing (or would like to get back into doing). Thanks to those things and her stellar communication throughout the process I have been able to feel this connection with myself again that pain pushed so far away for so long. My journey is far from over but without Hannah I wouldn’t be back on the road to recovery.

If you're laying in a hospital bed after having a serious condition that needs rehab, take an active role and deciding your next steps. Make sure you have active conversations with your case manager and if you're within a reasonable distance choose Encompass for your rehab.
From the check-in through the discharge my experience was all about rehab. The techs and nurses are extremely helpful almost to the point where they get in the way of rehab. I had to insist a few times that I can tie my own shoes. I checked in on a Saturday and honestly things are a little slower there on Saturdays and Sundays. But they do have therapists available if you want to do therapy on weekends which I did. Then first thing Monday morning my schedule was filled with a minimum of 3 hours per day.
I would like to mention and express my gratitude to all the therapists, nurses techs, docs, administrators and kitchen and housekeeping staff: Sue, Olivia, Jessica, Amanda, Dr Mendelson, Dr 'D', Dawn, Dana, Lisa, Morgan, Chris, Edith, Crystal, Judy, the techs and nurses whose names escape me, and the managers (sorry if I forgot anyone). It's obvious the place is well manged from the way things function. The scheduling was impressive as was the flexibility to adapt it. I would not want to forget the kitchen, the menus every couple of days and the good food albeit a heart healthy diet was very tasty and varied.
There are many angels among the staff of Encompass and I am very happy it was recommended to me, so I recommend it to anyone needing compassionate and more importantly effective care.

After dealing with vertigo for over six weeks, I was referred to an ENT specialist, who simply confirmed that I had BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) on my right side—something I already knew. I was then sent to a physical therapist to have a maneuver performed, though I’m still unsure why it couldn’t have been done in the doctor’s office. I was charged $150 just for the consultation, which lasted only 10 minutes, where I was told what I already knew.

Then, I went to Envision Physical Therapy, and that’s when everything changed. Stephanie was incredible—she immediately performed a maneuver, and within just one visit, the spinning stopped! I returned a few more times for additional maneuvers to help reset my body’s signals to the nervous system, as the issue had persisted for so long. I honestly wish my doctor or anyone else had informed me that all I needed was a physical therapist who specialized in these maneuvers, which only took about 30 minutes to provide lasting relief.

I’ve got 12 years of horse experience, owning and all, and wanted to volunteer at a local rescue as it gave me something extra to do on weekends. I was open about my experience and was quickly allowed to handle horses and was invited onto the medical team. Little did I know the volunteers on the medical team don’t actually get to help with common issues like rain rot, thrush, etc. I was quite disappointed as I wanted to do more for the horses as I had the experience and ability to deal with easy issues such as. As I went throughout my day volunteering, I was met with hostility when I wasn’t cleaning up after the horses and in turn doing tasks that we were asked to do on the whiteboard in the break room. On multiple occasions I was met with passive aggressive comments from volunteers and staff due to me not going to classes for horse related activities as I already knew what they were teaching. I was treated like a know it all and a child even though I am of legal age and had the same amount of knowledge as a lot of the staff or adults there. In my opinion, some of the staff don’t have a very welcoming personality and aren’t very helpful. I’ve even seen a specific staff member hit horses after provoking them herself and notified people of it, but she is still allowed to ride and work with these horses. For the sake of the horses, I hope a staff member reads this and decides they want to investigate to do better for eraf.

I loved most of the staff members there but the ones who were biased didn't exactly hide their judgements very well or opinions. If you love cleaning and grooming, yes. Volunteer here.

Analese, the owner, truly cares about the horses, all of them. She has one of my horses because I knew I'd never find a better home for her, and she's has taken her so much further than I could have imagined. I've never met a mean person while at Equistarre.

Essential Paws Island Resort,(772) 201-0094,ChIJYxTZsu7w3ogRwmySgLIMERA,Maria DePietro,5,"Look. Listen. FRIEND—I’ve recommended Essential Paws to everyone I know, but I’ve also been a little lowkey about it because this place is seriously a hidden gem. It’s not just doggy daycare…it’s a 5-star -adventure-experience for your dog! One day soon, I’m telling you right now, this place is going to blow up and go viral.
From day one, I knew this was the place for my boy Mr. Fiji. The energy, the love, the way they treat each pup like a VIP—it’s unmatched. They host the most adorable, fun events (YES, actual themed parties for dogs!), and they make every dog and human feel so special. And each event and holiday more memorable 💕😭🙏🏼Just look at these pics of Fiji living his best life at their events and during daycare!

Mariah deserves all the clout—her passion, creativity, and genuine love for the dogs shines every single time. She has gone above and beyond to make every visit special. Her passion, creativity, and attention to detail (especially with the events!) truly stand out.

Gabby, the amazing owner, has created something truly special here—safe, loving, and full of joy. And the rest of the crew—Manny, Myla, and Jasmine—are just as incredible. Fiji is so excited each time one of them greets him. He knows what time it is the second we’re coming over the bridge - essential paws pawty time 🤣😎 Every team member makes it feel like family (actually, better than family—because I trust them with Fiji more than I trust my own family!).

Essential Skills Pediatric Therapy,(352) 600-8300,ChIJcVH6-YUf6IgRWtILBE8Hnbk,melody Mendoza,1,I regret taking my son here. The staff at this place is horrible. My 3 year old autistic child needs speech and OT. It takes my son time to adjust and trust other people that is not family. Every time he will go in for speech Ms Alyssa suggested that she should grab my son so he can get use to her. But he refused to be touch by someone one else and kept insisting. My son will throw himself on the floor and all she says let him cry let it be. My son is very attach to his sister and he will prefer for her to go in. And my daughter sees it all on how she kept grabbing him when he didn’t want to. I as a parent told upper staff leslie that I will prefer for us to walk him in until he starts building trust. When it was time for OT staff Amanda let my son cry in a corner. I do understand that kids need to learn structure but not in that manner. Because my son went to a corner to cry she removed the pillows that he wanted to hide from and he rolled over a bang himself on the wall. My son started to cry really bad and Amanda didn’t bother to help him. I had to pin my daughter phone because my son was crying a lot. When it was time to leave Amanda didn’t even had the audacity to look at me in the face and walked away. All they say is let them cry let them cry they will get over it. Last week i went in with my son and the whole entire hour my son cried and cried hiding and Alyssa said let him be he will grow out of it. I dislike the fact that whole hour he didnt receive therapy. I feel like they don’t know how to treat kids that has autism and just want to jump to conclusions. I don’t recommend this place.

To say seeing this Milestone has been the greatest reward and blessing. From very early on i struggled to find speech therapy for my son even while both of my children were receiving therapy at another place. I was desperate and crying when Mrs. Emily answered the phone. I could immediately feel the relief. My son was 2 yrs old and could not speak and my daughter was 5 yrs old and struggling even though she had been in OT for 2 yrs getting a feather rubbed against her arm for tolerating. Yet she couldn't complete daily tasks without her skin crawling.  Dr. Logan Detweiler and Mrs. Amanda came into our lives and he truly changed our norm! Ms. Alyssa went straight to work with my son and now he speaks fluently in his dialect Patois, and English and he is able to conversate! To reiterate we were 2 parents desperately trying to meet the needs of our children and what felt like failure we were met WITH THE ESSENTIAL SKILLS we  needed! My children have behavioral struggles and each therapist always treated our children their client with the upmoat respect and compassion! This team is The BEST OF THE BEST!

I can't recommend this place enough for several reasons. Here are just a few:
- My son loves coming here.
- His therapists are great at communicating with me about what is done during his sessions. This is especially helpful so I can try to reinforce what his therapists are doing with him.
- He's been there long enough that the ""honeymoon period"" is over and they continue to show him the same kindness, compassion, and patience as they did on Day 1.

Evolve Performance & Recovery,(570) 337-9975,ChIJyc9GB3nFwogRinAI7uf7E4Y,K C,5,"After enduring over 18 months of mobility issues and relying on a walker due to GBS syndrome, I'm incredibly blessed to have crossed paths with Dr. John. Dealing with insurance and mediocre physical therapy was a constant struggle, and I was seeing multiple specialists just to get the care I needed.

Discovering Dr. John was a game-changer because he offers comprehensive care all in one place. There's no need to drive all over town to a personal trainer, then to physical therapy, then to your massage therapist, and then try to find someone who offers dry needling and scraping. We've only been working together for about 12 weeks, but I'm already experiencing an incredible difference. My time with other providers in town simply doesn't compare.

Dr. John is patient, knowledgeable, and genuinely wants the best for his clients. He's like having four specialists in one! If you're not working with this genius, you're truly missing out.

He provides:
* Strength training
* Physical therapy
* Dry needling
* Cupping
* Scraping
* Adjustments
* Stretching

He does it all and is a total game-changer! Book with him ASAP – you won't regret it!",2025-06-30 18:13:59,3 months ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUnrIChsbVfOe5PfcjY6gnfONk8OfCNiAzeygABUjL6_0TiyBw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2,2025-10-13 18:06:23.977593,,

He's been attending for almost a year now and Kathy is absolutely amazing along with the other RBTs Madison, Katie, Bri, etc. My son has never been out of my sight in anyone's care because of course the world is crazy so I was super nervous about leaving him here but Kathy made all my nerves go away with the group chat they have with all the RBTs. They send pictures and updates throughout the day with the chat and he's always super happy! The days he didn't have ABA he would be bothered and I knew then that he was attached to them which made me superrrrr happy! He wasn't saying much but a couple of words when he started if any and he was 3 years old but now he's 4 and he's saying sooooo much! He utilizes his things he learns at ABA at home. Kathy gives us educational literature to teach us things about autism and anything new to do with our son which makes me aware of how much she analyzes the kids so they reach their full potential! I am so thankful that I trusted the process because I'm super excited for our son to see where he will be in the future. When he was first diagnosed with autism I was terrified of him being capable to be like other kids without autism but Exceptional Therapies gives not only our son confidence but us as parents. Huge thanks to Exceptional Therapies!

Actually, I limped in, barely able to walk or stand. I had been suffering for approximately 3 months and visited the ER a week prior to coming to Experience. The ER visit and follow-up resulted in getting on a heavy dose of pain meds. I'm normally a very active person, and at 54 years of age, I do have some chronic pain from sports related injuries. This particular period of time was unbearable. I was skeptical that anything could be done. However, I started Soft Wave, Adjustments, and Traction two days a week. Within two weeks I was walking normal and finally able to get good sleep. Within a month, I was back to my daily routine of biking, strength training, running, and walking. I was beyond ecstatic over my progress. This week (Sept 2025) I had follow up x-rays and it doesn't even look like the same person/spine from my images in May.

Unfortunately, things went downhill quickly. I was crying, overwhelmed, and struggling to understand what the doctor was saying when they started explaining surgery to remove her eye. They did go over other options, but all still required medications. They said removal was the best option. While I was breaking down, I felt like they had zero sympathy. They eventually gave me a few minutes to think, but the tech who came in was extremely rude when I told her I needed to wait to hear back from my vet tech before making the final decision. She snapped back that I had to wait for my vet tech. I explained that yes, I always run everything through her, but the way it was said felt dismissive and uncaring. She also got upset and made me feel a bit stupid when I requested detailed info on which eye drop goes first.  She said it will all be written down. I understand that but I wanted to make sure I rolled all instructions.

Then they told me surgery could be scheduled for next week, but later offered a sooner date. I chose sooner, but then they added in bloodwork. Also was prescribed medication for her skin something my vet tech later confirmed wasn’t even necessary.

To make things worse, I later found out this clinic is owned by a certain company and honestly, it feels like all they care about is money and could care less about the most important things compassion, patience, and understanding in a very emotional time.

The even got rude with my primary doctor and the lady got rude with me over the phone when I called to cancel because my vet was able to do the procedure half the cost and other things my dog needed.

This place needs to think about how they treat the owners and speak to them because not one of them has a sense of compassion.",2025-09-25 20:39:05,2 weeks ago,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWsoy5-Ig3ZyPIn3c-21pYvEtkI6Ic017zbiwv05UtUc6klc8U=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4,2025-10-13 18:06:30.303584,,

Dr. Fife and the team quickly and accurately diagnosed him with a severe case of anterior uveitis.

My husband is a veterinary dentist, so we understand firsthand the importance of involving specialists in complex cases. Dr. Fife’s expertise, along with the clinic’s advanced diagnostic tools, ensured Duke received the precise care he needed.

We’re incredibly grateful for the professionalism, compassion, and knowledge shown by Dr. Fife and the entire staff.
