  "description": "Florida KidCare is the state's subsidized health insurance program for children from birth through age 18, providing comprehensive coverage including autism-related services. The program offers four different insurance options based on family income and includes coverage for behavioral health therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and developmental screenings. Florida KidCare makes quality healthcare affordable for families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. Children with autism receive medically necessary treatments through participating providers across the state.",
