  "description": "Florida's Early Steps program provides free early intervention services to infants and toddlers (birth to 36 months) with developmental delays, disabilities, and at-risk conditions. The program is part of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C and is administered by the Florida Department of Health.\n\nEarly Steps services are provided at no cost to families, regardless of income. Services are delivered in the child's natural environment—typically the home—and include speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, developmental services, and family support.\n\nChildren may qualify for Early Steps if they have a diagnosed condition likely to result in developmental delay (such as autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, or cerebral palsy), or if they show significant delays in areas like communication, motor skills, cognitive development, or adaptive behavior.\n\nWhen a child turns 3, they transition out of Early Steps to services through the local school district or other community programs. Recent legislation (Senate Bill 112, signed in 2024) extended eligibility through age 4, pending federal approval, to help bridge the gap between early intervention and school-based services.\n\nProviders who participate in Early Steps can bill the program directly for covered therapy services.",
