  "description": "Medicare provides health insurance coverage for individuals with autism who are 65 or older, or adults under 65 who qualify through Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) after receiving disability benefits for 24 months. While Medicare coverage for autism services is more limited than Medicaid or private insurance, it does cover certain medically necessary treatments and services. Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers diagnostic evaluations, psychiatric services, medication management, and mental health counseling when provided by qualified healthcare professionals who accept Medicare. However, Medicare traditionally has not covered Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, which is considered the gold standard treatment for autism, because ABA providers (BCBAs) are not currently recognized as Medicare-eligible providers under federal regulations. Medicare does cover speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy when these services are deemed medically necessary and are provided to help restore or improve function. Adults with autism who have Medicare may benefit from psychiatric care for co-occurring conditions like anxiety or depression, counseling services through licensed clinical social workers or psychologists, and medication management by physicians or nurse practitioners.",
