  "description": "Cigna provides extensive autism spectrum disorder coverage through their health insurance plans, including behavioral health services, ABA therapy, and related treatments for both children and adults. Florida residents with Cigna insurance can access comprehensive autism services including diagnostic evaluations, ABA therapy, speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and developmental assessments. Cigna complies with Florida's autism insurance mandate, which requires coverage for autism-related services, and their plans typically include coverage for evidence-based interventions recommended by licensed healthcare providers. ABA therapy coverage through Cigna usually requires prior authorization, with treatment plans reviewed and approved by their behavioral health team before services begin. Most Cigna plans cover medically necessary ABA services provided by qualified BCBAs and supervised RBTs, with coverage varying based on your specific plan type (HMO, PPO, or EPO). Out-of-pocket costs depend on your deductible, coinsurance rate, and copayment structure, with typical copays ranging from $15-60 per therapy session. Some Cigna plans have annual visit limits or therapy caps, while others provide more extensive coverage based on medical necessity determinations. To begin services, families need an autism diagnosis from a qualified provider, followed by a referral to an in-network ABA provider who will complete an initial assessment and develop a comprehensive treatment plan for Cigna's review.",
