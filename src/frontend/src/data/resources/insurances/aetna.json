  "description": "Aetna offers comprehensive autism coverage for children and adults through most of their health insurance plans, including coverage for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and other medically necessary autism treatments. Under Florida law and the federal Mental Health Parity Act, Aetna plans are required to cover autism services at the same level as other medical conditions. Most Aetna plans cover ABA therapy with varying session limits and may require prior authorization before treatment begins. Typical coverage includes diagnostic evaluations by qualified professionals, ongoing behavioral assessments, and treatment by Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) and Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs). Aetna members in Florida can access in-network ABA providers, developmental pediatricians, and autism specialists. Out-of-pocket costs vary by plan type, deductible, and coinsurance rates, with many families paying copays of $20-50 per therapy session after meeting their deductible. Some Aetna plans have annual therapy visit limits or dollar caps, so it's important to review your specific plan documents or contact member services to understand your exact benefits. To access autism services through Aetna, families typically need a formal autism diagnosis from a qualified healthcare provider, followed by a referral to an ABA provider who will conduct an initial assessment and submit a treatment plan for prior authorization. Aetna also covers related services such as psychiatric care, medication management, and social skills training when deemed medically necessary by a qualified provider.",
