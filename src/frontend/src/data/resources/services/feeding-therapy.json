  "description": "Feeding therapy helps children who struggle with eating due to sensory sensitivities, oral motor difficulties, or behavioral challenges. Many children with autism experience significant feeding issues, including extreme food selectivity, texture aversions, and difficulty with chewing or swallowing. Feeding therapists, typically speech-language pathologists or occupational therapists with specialized training, work to expand food acceptance, improve oral motor skills, and create positive mealtime experiences. Therapy may address sensory processing, muscle coordination, and anxiety around new foods.",
