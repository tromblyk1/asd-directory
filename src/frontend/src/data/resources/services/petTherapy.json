  "title": "Animal-Assisted Therapy",
  "description": "Animal-assisted therapy incorporates trained animals, typically dogs or horses, into therapeutic interventions to support communication, social skills, emotional regulation, and sensory integration for individuals with autism. The presence of animals can reduce anxiety, motivate engagement, and provide non-judgmental companionship that facilitates therapeutic progress. Therapy animals work alongside licensed therapists in structured sessions targeting specific treatment goals. Services include equine-assisted therapy, canine-assisted therapy, and other animal interactions available through specialized programs and therapeutic facilities throughout Florida. Some families also pursue service dogs trained specifically for autism support.",
