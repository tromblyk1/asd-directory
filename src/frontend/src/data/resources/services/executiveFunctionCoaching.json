  "description": "Executive function coaching helps individuals with autism develop skills in planning, organization, time management, task initiation, and self-regulation. Many people with autism experience challenges with executive functioning, which impacts academic performance, work productivity, and daily living independence. Coaches work one-on-one to teach strategies, create systems, and build habits that support executive function development. Services are provided by educational specialists, psychologists, occupational therapists, and trained executive function coaches through schools, private practices, and online platforms. Executive function coaching is particularly valuable for adolescents and adults with autism transitioning to increased independence.",
