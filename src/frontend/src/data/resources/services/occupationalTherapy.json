  "description": "Occupational therapy helps individuals with autism develop, recover, or maintain skills needed for daily living and meaningful activities. OT practitioners address sensory processing differences, fine and gross motor skills, self-care abilities, handwriting, and social participation. Treatment often includes sensory integration therapy, adaptive strategies, and environmental modifications to support success at home, school, and in the community. Occupational therapists in Florida work in schools, clinics, hospitals, and private practices, with services covered by most insurance plans including Medicaid when medically necessary.",
