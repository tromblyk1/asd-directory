  "description": "Social skills groups provide structured environments where individuals with autism can practice social interactions, communication, and relationship-building with peers under professional guidance. These therapeutic groups target specific skills such as conversation, perspective-taking, emotional regulation, and friendship development through activities, role-playing, and real-time coaching. Groups are typically organized by age and skill level and led by psychologists, social workers, speech-language pathologists, or behavior analysts. Social skills groups are widely available in Florida through therapy centers, schools, community organizations, and private practices, offering both in-person and virtual options.",
