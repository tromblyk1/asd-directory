  "description": "Parent coaching empowers caregivers with strategies, knowledge, and support to effectively teach skills and manage challenging behaviors in their children with autism. Coaches train parents in evidence-based techniques such as applied behavior analysis principles, visual supports, communication strategies, and positive behavior support. This collaborative approach helps families generalize therapeutic gains across settings and sustain progress between formal therapy sessions. Parent coaching is provided by behavior analysts, psychologists, and trained parent educators through agencies, private practices, and online platforms. Many autism service providers in Florida incorporate parent training as an essential component of comprehensive intervention.",
