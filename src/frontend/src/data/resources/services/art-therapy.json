  "shortDescription": "Creative therapeutic approach using art activities to support emotional expression, motor skills, and cognitive development.",
  "description": "Art therapy uses creative processes like painting, drawing, sculpting, and other art forms as therapeutic tools to help children express emotions, develop fine motor skills, and improve cognitive abilities. For children with autism and other developmental differences, art therapy provides a non-verbal outlet for communication and self-expression. Guided by trained therapists, children explore different materials and techniques at their own pace, building confidence while developing sensory processing skills, hand-eye coordination, and social interaction abilities in a supportive environment.",
