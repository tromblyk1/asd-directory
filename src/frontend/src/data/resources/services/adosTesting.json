  "title": "ADOS Testing",
  "description": "The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a standardized assessment tool used to diagnose autism spectrum disorder across different ages and developmental levels. ADOS testing involves structured and semi-structured activities that allow trained clinicians to observe social interaction, communication, play, and repetitive behaviors. The assessment is considered the gold standard in autism diagnosis and is typically administered by psychologists, developmental pediatricians, or specially trained clinicians. In Florida, ADOS testing is available through university clinics, diagnostic centers, hospitals, and private practices, and is often covered by insurance as part of a comprehensive autism evaluation.",
