  "description": "Faith-based autism support services include neurodivergent-friendly religious programs, spiritual counseling, special needs ministries, and inclusive worship experiences for individuals with autism and their families. Many churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations in Florida offer adapted religious education, sensory-friendly services, respite care during worship, and peer support groups. These programs provide spiritual community while accommodating sensory sensitivities, communication differences, and behavioral needs. Faith-based support complements therapeutic services by addressing the spiritual and social needs of families raising children with autism within their religious communities.",
