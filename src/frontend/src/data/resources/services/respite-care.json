  "description": "Respite care provides temporary relief for family caregivers by offering short-term care for individuals with autism. Trained respite workers can provide care in the family home, at a respite facility, or in the community. This allows parents and caregivers to rest, attend to other responsibilities, or simply take a break while knowing their loved one is in capable hands. Respite care is essential for preventing caregiver burnout and maintaining family well-being.",
