  "description": "Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) encompasses all forms of communication outside of oral speech. For individuals with autism who are nonverbal or have limited verbal abilities, AAC provides a way to express needs, share thoughts, and connect with others. AAC ranges from low-tech options like picture boards and communication books to high-tech speech-generating devices and tablet apps. Research consistently shows that AAC does not prevent speech development—in fact, it often encourages spoken language by reducing frustration and modeling how communication works.",
