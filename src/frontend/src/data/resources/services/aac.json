  "description": "Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) encompasses various methods and tools that help individuals with autism who have difficulty with verbal communication to express themselves effectively. AAC includes low-tech options like picture boards and high-tech solutions such as speech-generating devices and communication apps. Many individuals with autism benefit from AAC to reduce frustration, enhance social interactions, and support language development. AAC services in Florida are provided by speech-language pathologists and assistive technology specialists through schools, therapy centers, and private practice.",
