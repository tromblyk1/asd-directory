  "description": "The Institute for Neuro-Physiological Psychology method focuses on identifying and addressing retained primitive reflexes that may contribute to developmental challenges in children with autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions. INPP practitioners assess neurological development and provide specific movement exercises designed to integrate these reflexes, potentially improving motor coordination, attention, sensory processing, and learning abilities. While not exclusively an autism treatment, some families report benefits when INPP is used as part of a comprehensive intervention plan. INPP-trained practitioners in Florida offer assessments and individualized exercise programs through private practices and specialized clinics.",
