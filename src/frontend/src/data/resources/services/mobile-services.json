  "description": "Mobile services bring therapy directly to where the child lives, learns, or plays. Therapists travel to homes, schools, daycares, or community locations to provide services in natural environments. This approach can be especially beneficial for children with autism who struggle with transitions or perform differently in clinical settings. Mobile services allow therapists to address real-world challenges in the actual environments where skills need to be used.",
