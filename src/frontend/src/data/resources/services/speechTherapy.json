  "description": "Speech-language therapy addresses communication challenges experienced by many individuals with autism, including expressive and receptive language, articulation, pragmatic language, and social communication skills. Speech-language pathologists develop individualized treatment plans that may incorporate verbal speech, augmentative communication systems, visual supports, and social skills training. Therapy goals often include expanding vocabulary, improving conversation skills, understanding nonverbal communication, and developing functional communication abilities. Speech therapy is one of the most commonly utilized services for autism and is available throughout Florida in schools, clinics, hospitals, and private practices, with coverage through most insurance plans including Medicaid.",
