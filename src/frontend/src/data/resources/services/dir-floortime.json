  "description": "DIR/Floortime (Developmental, Individual-Difference, Relationship-based model) is a therapeutic approach that focuses on building emotional connections through child-led play. Therapists and parents literally get down on the floor to engage with children at their level, following the child's lead while gently challenging them to climb the developmental ladder. This approach emphasizes the importance of relationships and emotional development as the foundation for all learning.",
