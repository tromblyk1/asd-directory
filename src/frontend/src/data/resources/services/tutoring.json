  "description": "Specialized tutoring provides individualized academic instruction for students with autism, addressing learning challenges, building on strengths, and supporting success in school subjects. Tutors experienced in autism use multisensory teaching methods, visual supports, structured approaches, and accommodations tailored to each student's learning style and needs. Tutoring can target specific academic skills, homework completion, organization, test preparation, or compensatory strategies for learning differences. Services are available through private tutors, learning centers, school-based programs, and online platforms throughout Florida. Some families access tutoring through educational scholarships or as a related service in Individualized Education Programs.",
