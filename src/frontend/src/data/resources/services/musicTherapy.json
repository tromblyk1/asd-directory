  "description": "Music therapy uses clinical and evidence-based music interventions to address communication, social, emotional, and sensory needs of individuals with autism. Board-certified music therapists design individualized sessions that may include singing, instrument playing, songwriting, and music listening to work on goals such as verbal and nonverbal communication, social interaction, attention, and emotional regulation. Music therapy capitalizes on the affinity many individuals with autism have for music and sound patterns. Services are available throughout Florida in clinical settings, schools, community programs, and private practices, with some insurance plans covering music therapy as a related service.",
