  "description": "Physical therapy addresses gross motor skill development, strength, balance, coordination, and mobility for individuals with autism who experience motor delays or challenges. Physical therapists design individualized treatment plans to improve functional movement patterns, postural control, and participation in physical activities. Interventions may include therapeutic exercises, gait training, balance activities, and adaptive equipment recommendations. PT is particularly beneficial for children with autism who have low muscle tone, motor planning difficulties, or developmental coordination disorder. Services are available throughout Florida in schools, clinics, hospitals, and private practices, with coverage through most insurance plans including Medicaid.",
