  "description": "DIR/Floortime (Developmental, Individual-Difference, Relationship-Based model) is a therapeutic approach for children with autism that emphasizes emotional and relational development through child-led play interactions. This intervention focuses on building foundational capacities for relating, communicating, and thinking by meeting the child at their developmental level and following their interests. DIR/Floortime practitioners work with families to create engaging play experiences that promote emotional connections and developmental progress. The approach is available in Florida through trained occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychologists, and specialized DIR providers in clinical and home settings.",
