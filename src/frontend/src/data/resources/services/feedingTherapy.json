  "description": "Feeding therapy addresses eating difficulties commonly experienced by children with autism, including food selectivity, oral motor challenges, sensory sensitivities, and behavioral resistance to trying new foods. Therapists use evidence-based approaches to gradually expand food repertoires, improve oral motor skills, and reduce mealtime stress. Feeding therapy is typically provided by occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and registered dietitians who specialize in pediatric feeding disorders. Services are available throughout Florida in clinical settings, homes, and specialized feeding programs, with many insurance plans covering medically necessary feeding interventions.",
