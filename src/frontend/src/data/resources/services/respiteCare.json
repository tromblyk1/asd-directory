  "description": "Respite care provides temporary relief for family caregivers of individuals with autism, offering short-term care and supervision to prevent caregiver burnout and support family well-being. Respite services can be provided in-home, in community settings, or through overnight programs, allowing caregivers time for rest, appointments, work, or personal activities. Florida offers respite care through various sources including the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Medicaid waivers, private agencies, and nonprofit organizations. Trained respite workers understand autism and can provide appropriate care, supervision, and engagement during respite periods, with services ranging from a few hours to multiple days.",
