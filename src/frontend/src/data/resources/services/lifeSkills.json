  "description": "Life skills training teaches individuals with autism essential competencies for independent living including personal hygiene, cooking, money management, household tasks, transportation, and community navigation. These programs use systematic instruction, visual supports, and repeated practice to build functional skills necessary for adult independence. Life skills training is provided by occupational therapists, special education teachers, behavior analysts, and specialized programs through schools, community agencies, and residential facilities. Florida offers various life skills programs through the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, vocational rehabilitation services, and private providers, with services tailored to different age groups and ability levels.",
