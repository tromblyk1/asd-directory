  "description": "Baptist schools are Christian educational institutions affiliated with Baptist churches and denominations. These schools integrate biblical teaching and Christian values throughout their academic curriculum.\n\nKey characteristics of Baptist schools:\n\n• Bible-based curriculum with daily scripture study and chapel services\n• Emphasis on traditional Christian values and character development\n• Often connected to local Baptist churches and congregations\n• Focus on academic excellence alongside spiritual formation\n• Typically offer smaller class sizes with individualized attention\n\nBaptist schools vary in their specific practices and affiliations, as Baptist churches are autonomous congregations. Some may be affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, American Baptist Churches USA, or independent Baptist associations.\n\nMany Baptist schools in Florida participate in state scholarship programs including FES-UA (for students with unique abilities), FTC, and FES-EO, making private Christian education more accessible to families.\n\nWhen considering a Baptist school, ask about their specific denominational affiliation, statement of faith, and how biblical teaching is integrated into daily instruction.",
