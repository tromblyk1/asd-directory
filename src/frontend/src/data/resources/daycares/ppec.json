  "description": "Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) centers are licensed medical daycare facilities that provide comprehensive care for children with complex medical needs. Unlike traditional daycares, PPECs are staffed with registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants who can administer medications, manage feeding tubes, provide respiratory support, and monitor medical conditions. Many PPECs also offer on-site therapy services including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. PPEC care is typically covered 100% by Florida Medicaid for eligible children, with no copays or out-of-pocket costs for families.",
