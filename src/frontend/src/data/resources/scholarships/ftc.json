  "description": "The Florida Tax Credit Scholarship (FTC) is a state-funded program that provides scholarships to low-income families enabling their children to attend private schools of choice. This program benefits families of children with autism by offering access to schools with specialized programs, smaller teacher-to-student ratios, and individualized instruction approaches. The FTC scholarship covers tuition and fees at participating private schools throughout Florida. Eligibility is determined by household income relative to the federal poverty level, and priority is given to students from families with the greatest financial need.",
