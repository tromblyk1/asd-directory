  "description": "The Hope Scholarship Program provides Florida public school students who have been subjected to violence or harassment, including bullying, the opportunity to transfer to another public school or receive a scholarship to attend an eligible private school. This program can be particularly beneficial for students with autism who experience bullying or struggle in traditional public school environments. The scholarship covers tuition and fees at participating private schools or transportation costs for transfers to other public schools. Parents must report the incident according to their school district's policy to be eligible.",
