  "description": "Nonprofit private schools are 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations that operate for educational purposes rather than profit. These schools reinvest all revenue back into their educational programs, facilities, and student services.\n\nBenefits of nonprofit schools often include:\n\n• Financial aid and scholarship opportunities funded by donations and grants\n• Sliding scale tuition based on family income\n• Mission-driven focus on student outcomes rather than profits\n• Community involvement and transparency in operations\n• Eligibility for government grants and foundation funding\n\nMany nonprofit schools actively work to make quality education accessible to families across all income levels. When evaluating schools, ask about their financial aid programs, payment plans, and any available scholarships beyond state programs like FES-UA or FTC.\n\nNonprofit status does not guarantee quality or accreditation - always verify a school's credentials independently. You can search for an organization's tax-exempt status through the IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search tool.",
